1. **追求财富，而不是金钱或地位**

财富、金钱和地位之间的差别。

纳瓦尔是一位多产的科技投资者，也是AngelList的创始人

尼维:你可能从他的推特账号上知道纳瓦尔。

我们将谈论他在推特上关于“如何致富(不需要通过幸运)”的风暴。“我们将详细浏览大部分推文，给纳瓦尔一个机会来扩展它们，并大致重复这个话题。他可能会提出一些他以前从未发表过的想法。

纳瓦尔是AngelList和Epinions的联合创始人。他也是Twitter、Uber等公司的多产科技投资者。

我是Naval AngelList的联合创始人。我和他曾经共同撰写了Venture Hacks博客。

纳瓦尔:《How To Get Rich tweet storm》确实触动了我的神经，并迅速走红。很多人说这是有帮助的。

科技行业之外的人，各行各业的人，人们都想知道如何解决他们关于钱的问题。每个人都模模糊糊地知道他们想要富有，但他们没有一套好的原则来实现。

## **财富是你睡觉时为你挣钱的资产**

尼维:财富、金钱和地位有什么不同?

纳瓦尔:财富是你想要的东西。财富是你睡觉时挣来的资产。财富是工厂，是制造东西的机器人。财富是晚上运行的电脑程序，为其他客户服务。财富甚至是银行里的钱，可以被重新投资到其他资产和其他业务上。

甚至房子也可以成为财富的一种形式，因为你可以把它租出去，尽管这可能比做一些商业地产利用率要低。

所以，我对财富的定义是，可以在你睡觉的时候帮你赚到更多的企业和资产的东西。

## **财富可以买到自由**

你想要财富的原因是因为它能买到你的自由。所以，你不必把领带戴在脖子上。所以，你不必在早上7点起床，赶着去上班，花时间在上下班的路上。所以，你不必浪费你的整个生命，把你所有的工作时间都浪费在一份没有灵魂的工作上。这份工作不能满足你。

你看，财富的目的就是自由。就是这样。它和买毛皮大衣，或驾驶法拉利，或驾驶游艇，或乘坐湾流飞机环游世界没有关系。那些东西其实非常无聊，非常愚蠢，转瞬即逝。

## **自由意味着你可以塑造自己的独特个体**

除非你真的想要财富，否则你不会得到它。全世界的人都想要它，全世界都在为此努力。

在某种程度上，这是一场竞争。这是一个正和博弈，但也有竞争因素。因为在任何时刻社会上的资源都是有限的。为了获得资源做你想做的，你必须脱颖而出。

## **钱是我们转移财富的方式**

钱是我们转移财富的方式。金钱是社会信用。它是一种借用别人的时间的信用和能力。

如果我把工作做好，如果我为社会创造价值，社会会说:“哦，谢谢你。我们对你过去所做的工作将来有所亏欠。这是我的借条。我们把它叫做钱吧。”

这些钱会贬值，因为人们会偷走借据。比如政府可以打印额外的借据。人们也可以不守信用。但是钱是一种可靠的欠条，它来自于社会，因为你或给你钱的人过去所做的事情而欠你钱。

我们可以把这些借据到处转。所以，钱是我们转移财富的方式。
## **地位是你在社会阶层中的位置**

人生基本上有两大游戏。一个是金钱游戏。钱不能解决你所有的问题，但它能解决你所有的钱的问题。我想大家都知道。他们意识到这一点，所以他们想赚钱。

但与此同时，他们中的许多人，在内心深处认为他们无法赚到钱。所以他们不希望任何财富创造发生。因此，他们通过攻击私人企业来表明他们的美德，他们说，“赚钱是罪恶的。你不应该这么做。”

但他们实际上在玩另一个游戏，那就是地位游戏。他们试图通过说“嗯，我不需要钱。我们不要钱。”来博取地位。

财富不是零和游戏。世界上每个人都可以有一所房子。因为你有房子并不影响我有房子的能力。建的房子越多，建房子就越容易，因为我们对建房子了解得越多。这样就有越多的人可以拥有房子。

财富是一个非常积极的正和游戏。我们一起创造。我们努力创造这件艺术品，来解释我们在做什么。最终，一些全新的东西将被创造出来。这是一个正和博弈。
## **地位是一个非常古老的零和游戏**

另一方面，地位是一个零和游戏。这是一个非常古老的游戏。我们从猴子部落开始就玩这个游戏了。这是等级制度。第一个是谁?2号是谁?3号是谁?为了让3号移动到2号，2号必须离开那个位置。所以，地位是一个零和游戏。

政治是地位游戏的一个例子。甚至体育运动也是地位游戏的一个例子。要想成为赢家，就必须有输家。我根本不喜欢地位游戏。但他们在我们的社会中也扮演着重要的角色，所以我们可以找出谁是负责人。但从根本上说，你玩它们是因为它们是一种不可避免的邪恶。

在进化的基础上，如果你回到几千年前，地位比财富更能预测生存。在农耕时代之前，你不可能拥有财富，因为你不能储存东西。采猎者把所有的东西都背在背上。

因此，狩猎采集者生活在完全以身份为基础的社会中。农民开始转向以财富为基础的社会。现代工业经济则更多的是基于财富的社会。

## **创造财富的人总是会受到地位游戏者的攻击**

地位和财富之间总是存在着微妙的竞争。例如，当记者攻击富人或科技行业时，他们实际上是在争取地位。他们说，“不，人更重要。而我，记者，代表人民，因此我更重要。”

问题在于，要想在一场地位游戏中取胜，你必须让别人失望。这就是为什么你应该在生活中避免地位游戏，因为它们会让你成为一个愤怒好斗的人。你总是在努力贬低别人，抬高自己，抬高你喜欢的人。

地位游戏总是存在的。别无他法，但要意识到，大多数时候，当你试图创造财富的时候，你会遭到别人的攻击，他们想让你看起来像个坏人。

他们试图以你为代价来提升自己的地位。他们在玩一个不同的游戏。这是一个更糟糕的游戏。这是一个零和游戏，而不是一个正和游戏。

2. **为世界创造更多**

财富不是从别人那里拿走什么，而是为世界创造富足。

## **符合道德的财富创造使世界更加富足**

纳瓦尔:我认为有人认为赚钱是罪恶的，对吗?它的根源可以追溯到“金钱是万恶之源”。“人们认为银行家偷了我们的钱。这在一定程度上是正确的，在世界上的很多地方，总是有很多盗窃发生。

从某种意义上说，世界的历史就是创造者和接受者之间的捕食者/猎物关系。有些人走出去创造东西，建造东西，努力工作。

还有一些人带着一把剑，一把枪，或者税收，裙带资本主义，或者共产主义，等等。有很多不同的偷窃方法。

即使在自然界，寄生生物的数量也比非寄生生物多。你体内有很多寄生虫，它们靠你生存。好的是共生的，他们会回馈一些东西。但也有很多只是在接受。这就是任何复杂系统构建的本质。

我关注的是真正的财富创造。这不是为了赚钱。这不是从别人那里拿走什么。它来自于创造富足。

显然，工作机会和财富都不是有限的。否则，我们还会坐在洞穴里，琢磨着如何分割火柴盒，偶尔还会有死鹿。

文明中的大部分财富，事实上全部财富，都是被创造出来的。它是从某处产生的。它是由人创造的。它是由科技创造的。它是由生产力创造的。它是通过艰苦的工作创造出来的。这种被窃取的想法是一种可怕的零和游戏，是人们试图博取地位的游戏。

## **每个人都可以变得富有**

但现实是，每个人都可以变得富有。我们可以看到，在第一世界，基本上每个人都比200年前活着的人更富有。

200年前没有人使用抗生素。没有人的汽车。没有人电。没有人有iPhone。所有这些都是使我们作为一个物种变得更富有的发明。

今天，我宁愿在第一世界国家做一个穷人，也不愿在路易十四的法国做一个富人。我今天宁愿做穷人也不愿做贵族。这是因为财富的创造。

技术的引擎是科学，它被应用于创造富足。所以，我认为基本上每个人都可以变得富有。

我想让你们思考的这个思维实验是，想象一下如果每个人都有一个好的软件工程师和一个好的硬件工程师的知识。如果你走出去，你能制造机器人，电脑，桥梁，并给它们编程。假设每个人都知道怎么做。

你认为20年后的社会会是什么样子?我的猜测是，我们将建造机器人、机器、软件和硬件来做任何事情。我们都会生活得非常富足。

我们本质上将会退休，因为我们没有人会为任何基本的东西而工作。我们甚至会有机器人护士。我们会有机器驱动的医院。我们会有自动驾驶汽车。我们将拥有100%自动化的农场。我们会有清洁能源。

在那个时候，我们可以利用技术突破来得到我们想要的一切。如果有人还在工作，他们就是在把工作当作一种表达创造力的方式。他们在工作，因为这是他们在贡献，建设和设计的东西。

我不认为资本主义是邪恶的。资本主义实际上是好的。只是它被劫持了。它被不当的外部因素所劫持。它被不正当的收益所劫持，在那里你可以发现腐败，或者垄断。


3. **自由市场是人类固有的天性**

我们是唯一跨越基因界限进行合作的动物，因为我们可以在自愿交换中追踪信用和借方。

## **自由市场是人类固有的**

纳瓦尔:全面的资本主义(意味着自由市场)是人类固有的。资本主义不是我们发明的。资本主义甚至不是我们发现的东西。它存在于我们的每一次交流中。

当你和我交换信息时，我想从你那里得到一些信息。我给你信息。你给我消息。如果我们没有很好的信息交流，你会去找别人。所以，交换的概念，记录信用和借方，这是我们作为灵活的社会动物与生俱来的。

我们是动物王国中唯一能跨越基因边界合作的动物。大多数动物甚至不合作。它们只会成群结队地行动，共同进化，它们共享血液，因此它们有一些共同的利益。

人类没有这个问题。我可以和你们合作。你们其中一个是塞尔维亚人。另一个是波斯人。我是印度人。我们几乎没有共同点，基本上没有。但我们仍然合作。

是什么让我们合作?因为我们可以记录借方和贷方。谁投入了多少工作?谁捐了多少?这就是自由市场资本主义。

因此，我坚信，这是人类与生俱来的，我们将为每个人创造越来越多的财富。

每个人都可以变得富有。每个人都可以退休。每个人都可以成功。这只是一个教育和欲望的问题。你必须想要它。如果你不想要，没关系。你可以选择退出游戏。

但是不要试图贬低那些正在玩游戏的人。因为这个游戏能让你晚上睡在温暖舒适的床上。这是一个能给你遮风挡雨的游戏。这就是让你的超市备货的游戏。这款游戏让你口袋里的iPhone嗡嗡作响。

所以，这是一个美丽的游戏，值得人类在道德上、理性上、道德上、社会上玩。它将继续使我们所有人变得越来越富有，直到我们为任何想要的人创造大量财富。

## **太多的索取者而没有足够的创造者将使一个社会陷入毁灭**

尼维:不只是个人在暗地里鄙视财富，对吧?有些国家、团体和政党公然蔑视财富。至少看起来是这样。

纳瓦尔:没错。一些国家、政党和团体沦落到地位的零和游戏。在破坏财富创造的过程中，他们把每个人都拉低到他们的水平。

这就是为什么美国是一个非常受移民欢迎的国家，因为美国梦。任何人都可以来到这里，作为穷人，然后努力工作赚钱，然后变得富有。即使只是为他们的生活赚一些基本的钱。

显然，财富的定义因人而异。第一世界公民对财富的定义可能是，“哦，我必须赚几百万美元，我已经赚完了。”

然而对于第三世界刚进入美国的贫困移民来说，我们是贫穷的移民，在我很小的时候就来到了美国，对于他们来说，财富可能要少得多。它可能只是，“我不需要在我的余生做一份我不想做的体力劳动。”

但是轻视创造财富的群体会把整个群体带到低水平。如果你有太多的接受者，而没有足够的创造者，社会就会分崩离析。最终你会看到一个共产主义国家。

看看委内瑞拉，对吧?他们忙着接受、分割和重新分配，以至于人们真的在街上挨饿，仅仅因为饥饿，他们的体重每年就会减轻几公斤。

另一种思考方法是想象一个有太多寄生虫的有机体。你需要少量的寄生虫来保持健康。你需要很多共生菌。所有细胞中帮助我们呼吸和燃烧氧气的线粒体。这些是帮助我们生存的共生体。没有他们我们无法生存。对我来说，他们是创造财富的伙伴，创造了人类的身体。

但是如果你体内充满了寄生虫，如果你感染了蠕虫，或者病毒，或者细菌，而这些都只是单纯的寄生，你就会死亡。所以，任何生物体都只能承受少量的寄生虫。当寄生元素失去控制时，你就会死亡。

我再次谈到道德的财富创造。我说的不是垄断。我说的不是裙带资本主义。我说的不是像环境这样定价错误的外部因素。

我说的是自由思想和自由市场。人与人之间的小规模交流是自愿的，不会对他人产生过大的影响。

我认为这种财富创造，如果一个社会不尊重它，如果一个群体不尊重它，那么这个社会就会陷入毁灭和黑暗。


4. **赚钱与运气无关**

赚钱与运气无关。而是要成为那种能赚钱的人。

## **赚钱与运气无关**

纳瓦尔:很明显，我们想要变得富有，我们想要在这一生中不依靠运气而到达那里。

很多人认为赚钱是靠运气。它不是。而是要成为那种能赚钱的人。

我喜欢这样想，如果我输光了所有的钱，如果你把我随便扔到任何一个讲英语的国家的大街上，在5到10年内，我就会再次变得富有。因为这是我发展的一套技能，我认为任何人都可以发展。

在1000个平行宇宙中，你想在999个平行宇宙中变得富有。你不会想在50个幸运的地方变得富有。

## **我们想借助于运气。**

我们谈论的运气有四种。这来自一本书。Pmarca, Marc Andreessen，写了一篇关于它的博客文章。

1. 盲目的运气

你可能会说第一种运气是盲目的运气。我很幸运，因为我完全无法控制的事情发生了。这就是命运，这就是命运。

2. 运气来自大量尝试

坚持不懈、努力工作、争分夺利、积极进取，你就会获得好运。当你四处奔波创造了很多机会，你产生了很多能量，你做了很多事情，很多事情会在尘埃中被搅动。

这就像把培养皿混合在一起，看什么能结合在一起。或者混合一些试剂看看什么能结合。你正在产生足够的力量、干劲和能量，幸运会找到你。

我们，作为一个群体，你可以说，正是因为这样才走到一起。Nenad把这些很棒的视频放到了网上，我在Twitter上看到的。从这个意义上说，他通过制作视频创造了自己的运气，直到像我这样的人不断地找到他。

3.有准备的运气

第三种方法是你变得非常善于发现运气。如果你在某一领域非常熟练，你会注意到在该领域某些幸运的突破，当其他人没有注意到的时候。所以你变得对运气敏感，这是通过技能、知识和工作。

**4. 幸运来自你独特的能力**

最后一种运气是最奇怪、最难的一种。但这就是我们要讨论的。这是你建立一个独特的性格，一个独特的品牌，一个独特的心态，然后运气找到你。

例如，假设你是世界上最擅长深海潜水的人。众所周知，你会进行无人敢尝试的深海潜水。

然后，完全靠运气，有人在海岸外发现了一艘沉没的宝船。他们得不到它。好吧，他们的好运变成了你的好运，因为他们会来找你得到那笔财富。你会得到报酬的。

这是一个极端的例子。那个找到宝箱而幸运的人，那是盲目的运气。但是他们来找你，要你把它取出来，却不得不给你一半，那不是运气。

你创造了自己的运气。你把自己放在一个可以利用这种运气的位置。或者在别人没有为自己创造机会的时候吸引好运。当我们谈论“不走运”时，我们想要确定，我们不想让它听天由命。

## **在1000个平行宇宙中，你想在999个平行宇宙中变得富有**

尼维:你想详细说明一下，在1000个平行宇宙中，你想在其中的999个变得富有吗?我想有些人会看到后说，“这听起来不可能，这听起来好得让人难以置信。”

纳瓦尔:不，我不认为这是不可能的。我认为，考虑到你的起步环境，你可能需要再努力一点。我在印度是个穷孩子，所以如果我能成功，从这个意义上说，任何人都能。

现在，很明显，我有了四肢，我有了心智，我接受了教育。有一些先决条件你无法通过。但如果你在听这个视频或播客，你可能有必要的手段，那就是一个正常运作的身体和一个正常运作的大脑。

一路上我遇到了很多倒霉的事。我赚的第一笔小钱，立刻就在股市上赔了。我赚的第二笔钱，或者说我应该赚的第二笔钱，基本上都被我的商业伙伴骗了。这已经是第三次了。

即便如此，它也一直处于缓慢而稳定的挣扎之中。我这辈子还没赚过一大笔钱。它总是由一大堆小事堆积而成。它更多的是通过创造商业来持续创造财富，包括机会和投资。这不是一次性的大事件。

## **财富不是一下子就能积累起来的，而是一次只能积累一块**

我的个人财富不是在某一年创造出来的。它会一点点堆积起来，一次一小块。更多的选择，更多的生意，更多的投资，更多我能做的事情。

和Nenad, illacertus一样，他也在网上建立自己的品牌。他建筑的是视频。没有任何一个视频会让他一夜暴富。这是一个漫长的一生的学习，阅读，创造，这将是复利。

我们谈论的是变得富有，这样你就可以退休，你就有你的自由。不必要退休，因为那样你会什么都不做。但从这个意义上说，你不必去任何你不想去的地方，你不必做任何你不想做的事，你可以想什么时候起床就什么时候睡觉，你没有老板。这就是自由。

我们谈论的是获得自由所需的足够的财富。不过，特别是由于现在有了互联网，机会非常多。事实上，我有太多的方法来赚钱，我没有足够的时间。我有很多机会从我的耳朵里喷涌而出，而我一直缺少的是时间。

创造财富，创造产品，创造企业，创造机会，以及作为副产品，从社会中获得报酬的方式太多了，我甚至无法应付。


5. **让运气成为你的命运**

## **在某种程度上，塑造你的性格，让运气成为决定性的。**

尼维:我觉得很有趣的是，你描述的前三种运气都是大家都知道的常用语。最后一种运气来自于你独特的行为方式，这可不是什么陈词滥调，以前没人说过。

所以，对于前三种，有“哑运气”或“盲运气”。“这是第一种幸运。第二种运气俗话说得好:“运气总是眷顾勇敢者。”谁得到幸运？只是搅拌锅和行动。第三种运气，人们说“机会总是青睐有准备的人。”

第四种运气,没有相匹配的一个常见的陈词滥调来描述，独特性格，你的行动,我认为这是有趣的,也许一个机会,它也表明,人们不一定利用这种运气，以他们应该的方式。

纳瓦尔:我认为在那个时候，它开始变得非常确定，不再是运气。所以，这个定义开始从运气变成，命运。所以，当你以某种方式塑造你的角色，然后你的角色就会成为你的命运时，这就是我所描述第四个特征。

## **塑造你的性格，让机会找到你**

我认为赚钱很重要的一点是，你拥有那种能让人们通过你做生意的声誉。我举个例子，如果你是一名出色的潜水员，那么寻宝者会来给你一份宝藏，作为你潜水技能的奖励。

如果你是一个值得信赖的,可靠的,高度集成的长期交易撮合人,当别人想做交易,但他们不知道如何与陌生人以可信的方式交易,他们会走近你,给你一个协议的削减或提供你一个独特的交易，只是因为你已经建立了的诚信和声誉。

沃伦·巴菲特，他得到了交易，他买了公司，他买了认股权证，拯救了银行，做了一些其他人不能做的事情，因为他的名声。

但这当然是脆弱的。它有责任，它有一个强大的品牌，我们稍后会谈到，这伴随着责任。

但我想说的是，你的性格，你的名声，这些都是你可以建立的东西，然后让你利用别人可能认为是幸运的机会，但你知道这不是幸运。

尼维:你说过第四种运气或多或少是一种命运。马克的博客文章中引用了原著中本杰明·迪斯雷利的一段话，我记得他是英国前首相。描述这种运气的名言是:“我们创造财富，我们称之为命运。”

## **你必须有点古怪，才能独自行走于前沿**

有几个其他有趣的事情，这样的运气在以前博客中提到,我认为这将有利于听众理解的是,这第四种运气几乎总是表现为古怪的方式,你做你的事情,有点古怪未必是一件坏事。事实上，这是一件好事。

纳瓦尔:是的,当然。因为这个世界是一个非常高效的地方，所以每个人都在所有显而易见的地方挖掘，去发现一些新的、新奇的、未被发现的东西，在前沿地带工作是有帮助的。

在那里，你必须有点古怪，才能独自走在前沿，然后你必须比其他人挖掘得更深，比看上去合理的更深，仅仅因为你感兴趣。

尼维:对，除了本杰明·迪斯雷利(Benjamin Disraeli)的那句话外，我看到的两句话也表达了这种运气，这句话来自山姆·阿尔特曼(Sam Altman)，他说:“极端的人会得到极端的结果。”“我觉得这很好。斯坦福大学教授杰弗里·普费弗说过，“你不可能是一个正常的人，却期待异常的回报。“我也一直很喜欢这个。

纳瓦尔:是的。我喜欢的一句正好相反的话是，“玩愚蠢的游戏赢得愚蠢的奖品。”“很多人花很多时间玩社交游戏，比如在Twitter上，你试图提高自己的社交地位，但你基本上赢得了毫无价值的愚蠢的社交奖项。

尼维:我想我从这篇博客文章中得到的最后一个想法是，通过追求这些运气，尤其是最后一种运气，基本上是除了哑巴运气之外的所有运气，通过追求它们，你基本上就会摆脱厄运。所以，如果你一直不停地搅拌锅里的东西，那么你的厄运就会一扫而光。

纳瓦尔:对，或者只是回归到均值。所以，你至少要中和掉坏运气，这样才能发挥你自己的才能。


6. **出租你的时间不会让你变得富有**

出租你的时间不会让你变得富有，因为你不能非线性地赚钱。

## **出租你的时间不会让你变得富有**

尼维:接下来你打算详细介绍你是如何变得富有的，以及你是如何变得不富有的。第一点是关于你如何不会变得富有:“你不会因为出租时间而变得富有。你必须拥有公司的股权，才能获得财务自由。”

纳瓦尔:这可能是最重要的一点。人们似乎认为你可以创造财富，通过工作赚钱。这可能行不通。原因有很多。

但最基本的是你的输入和输出紧密相连。几乎在任何有薪水的工作中，即使是像律师或医生这样每小时工资都很高的工作，你仍然在投入时间，而且每小时都有工资。

所以，这意味着当你睡觉的时候，你没有赚钱。当你退休的时候，你没有收入。当你在度假时，你不赚钱。你不可能得到非线性的回报。

如果你看看那些非常富有的医生，那是因为他们开了一家公司。私人诊所开业，私人诊所会建立一个品牌，这个品牌吸引了很多人。或者他们建立了某种医疗设备，或一个程序，或一个具有知识产权的过程。

所以，本质上来说，你是在为别人工作，而这个人承担着风险，有责任，有知识产权，有品牌。所以，他们不会付给你足够的钱。他们会付给你最低工资，让你做他们的工作。这可能是一个很高的小时工资，但在你退休的时候，这仍然不是真正的财富。

## **把时间租出去意味着你基本上是可以替代的**

最后，你甚至没有为社会创造那么多原创。正如我所说，这场推特风暴应该被称为“如何创造财富”。只是“如何致富”是一个更朗朗上口的标题。但你不是在为社会创造新事物。你只是在做一遍又一遍的重复事情。

你本质上是可替代的，因为你现在在扮演一个固定的角色。大多数固定的角色都可以教。如果他们能像在学校那样接受教育，那么最终你将会和一个拥有最新知识的人竞争，这个人已经接受了教育，即将取代你的位置。

你做的工作更有可能最终被机器人或人工智能取代。而且它甚至不需要一夜之间全部更换。它可以一次替换一点。这就会侵蚀你的财富创造能力，进而削弱你的赚钱能力。

所以，基本上输入和输出是匹配的。你是可替代的，你没有创造力。我只是不认为，这是一种真正赚钱的方式。

## **你必须拥有股权才能获得财务自由**

所以每个真正赚钱的人在某个时候都拥有一个产品，一个企业，或者某种知识产权。这可以通过股票期权，所以你可以在一家科技公司工作。这是一个很好的开始。

但通常，真正的财富是通过创办自己的公司，甚至是投资创造的。他们在一家投资公司，购买股票。这些才是通往财富的道路。它不会经过几个小时就能建立。

## **你真正想要的是一个你的投入和产出不匹配的职业**

你只是想要一份工作，一份职业，一份你的投入和产出不匹配的职业。如果你看看现代社会，这是稍后的推特风暴。拥有高创造力和高杠杆率的企业往往是那些你可以做一个小时工作的企业，却可以产生巨大的影响。或者你可以做1000个小时的工作，但是没有效果。

例如，看看软件工程。例如，一个伟大的工程师可以创造比特币，创造数十亿美元的价值。如果一个工程师做错了事情，或者做得不够好，或者不够有创意，不够深思熟虑，或者别的什么，他可以工作整整一年，而他们发布的每一段代码最终都不会被使用。顾客不需要它。

这是一个输入和输出高度分离的专业示例。它不是基于你投入的时间。

而在另一个极端，如果你是一个伐木工人，即使是世界上最好的伐木工人，假设你不使用工具，那么输入和输出显然是相连的。你只是用斧头，或者锯子。你知道，世界上最好的伐木工人可能比最差的伐木工人强三倍，对吧?不会有很大的不同。

所以，你想要寻找投入和产出高度分离的职业和职业。另一种说法是，你想要寻找可以作为杠杆的东西。我所说的杠杆并不是指金融杠杆，就像华尔街所使用的那样，它有一个不好的名声。我只是在说工具。我们使用的工具。

计算机是软件工程师使用的工具。如果我是一个伐木工人，有推土机、自动机器人斧头和锯子，我就会使用工具，比那些光着手试图把树连根拔起的人更有影响力。

工具和杠杆是造成输入和输出之间脱节的原因。这事关创造力，所以一个职业的创造力成分越高，它就越有可能有不连贯的输入和输出。

所以，我认为，如果你只考虑的是你的投入和产出高度相关的职业，那么在这个过程中，你将很难创造财富，也很难为自己创造财富。


7. **为了自由，要量入为出**

生活水平远远低于其收入水平的人们享受着一种自由，这种自由是忙于改善生活方式的人们所无法理解的。

## **量入为出的人有自由**

尼维:除了把时间租出去，你还应该避免做其他什么大事吗?

纳瓦尔:是的，我发布了两条相关的推文。我说的第一个问题是，你的生活方式应该如何升级，不应该升级得太快。这句话的意思是，那些生活水平远远低于他们收入水平的人享受着一种人们无法理解的自由，相对于那些忙于提升自己的生活方式的人。

我认为这是非常重要的，不要总是提升你的生活方式。维护你的自由。它给了你行动的自由。基本上，一旦你赚了一些钱，但你仍然想要像过去那样生活，烦恼就会消失。所以，不要跑出去升级房子，生活方式等等。

## **最危险的东西是海洛因和月薪**

假设你的工资是每小时1000美元。问题是，当你开始这样的工作生活方式时，你不会突然从每小时20美元涨到每小时1000美元。这是一个长期职业生涯的进步。

当这种情况发生时，一个微妙的问题是，随着你赚的钱越来越多，你的生活方式也在升级。这种生活方式的升级提升了你所认为的财富，而你却掉进了这个工资奴隶制的陷阱里。

我忘了是谁说的，也许是纳西姆·塔勒布。他说，“最危险的东西是海洛因和月薪。对，因为它们很容易上瘾。你想变得富有的方式让你变穷，只得工作，工作，再工作。

## **理想情况下，你应该以量子化的方式赚钱**

这就是科技产业的运作方式。你十年没赚到钱，然后突然在第11年，你可能会有一个巨大的回报。

顺便说一下，为什么这些所谓富人的高边际税率是有缺陷的，因为风险最高、最富创造力的职业，在你的一生中，实际上会损失10年的钱，而你却在冒着巨大的风险，不停地流血。然后突然在11年或15年，你可能只有一个大发薪日。但是当然，山姆大叔出现了，说，“嘿，你知道吗，你今年赚了很多钱。因此,你富有。因此，你是邪恶的，你必须把一切都交给我们。“所以，它会摧毁了那些创造性的冒险职业。

理想的情况是，你把钱分成几部分，分开很长一段时间，这样你自己的生活方式就没有机会快速适应，然后你基本上会说，“好吧，现在我做完了。现在我退休了。现在我自由了。我还会继续工作，因为你要用你的生命做点什么，但我只会在我想做的时候做我想做的事。因此，你会有更多创造性的表达方式，更少地关注金钱。


8. **给社会它不知道如何得到的东西**

社会会为你创造它想要的东西而付钱，这些东西它还不知道如何获得，也不知道如何大规模地实现它。

## **给社会它想要的、但不知道如何达到规模实现的东西**

尼维:把你的时间租出去是不会发财的。但，“你会通过给社会它想要的东西而致富，那些社会还不知道如何达到规模实现的东西。”

纳瓦尔:没错。所以，就像我们之前说的，钱是来自社会的欠条，“你过去做了一些好事。这是我们将来欠你们的。因此，社会会为你创造它想要的东西而付钱。

但社会还不知道如何创造这些东西，因为如果创造了，他们就不需要你了。早就被淘汰了。

几乎所有的东西，在你的房子里，在你的工作场所，在街上，都曾经一度是技术。曾有一段时间石油是一种技术，这让洛克菲勒变得富有。曾经有一段时间，汽车是一种技术，这让亨利·福特变得富有。

因此，正如艾伦•凯(Alan Kay)所说，技术只是一套还不太管用的东西(更正:丹尼•希利斯[Danny Hillis])。一旦某样东西起作用，它就不再是技术了。所以，社会总是想要新事物。

## **弄清楚你能提供什么产品，然后弄清楚如何扩展它**

如果你想变得富有，你得弄清楚你能为社会提供哪些东西，而社会还不知道如何获得，但它想要的，这对你来说很自然，在你的技能范围内，在你的能力范围内。

然后你要策划出如何缩放。因为如果你只建立一个，那是不够的。你必须建造成千上万的，成千上万的，成千上万的，成千上万的。所以，每个人都可以有一个。

史蒂夫·乔布斯和他的团队当然知道社会需要智能手机。他们口袋里的电脑拥有100倍于电话的功能，而且使用方便。所以，他们想出了如何建造它，然后他们想出了如何扩展它。

他们想出了如何让每一个第一世界的公民，最终也让每一个第三世界的公民，都能拥有一个。正因为如此，他们获得了丰厚的回报，苹果是世界上最有价值的公司。

尼维:我想说的是，企业家的工作就是为大众市场带来高端产品。

纳瓦尔:从高端开始。首先，这是一种创造性的行为。首先，你创建它只是因为你想要它。你想要它，你知道如何建造它，你需要它。所以你为自己建造。然后你要想办法把它带给其他人。然后富人会有一段时间拥有它。

比如，富人有司机，然后他们有黑色的城市汽车。然后优步出现了，每个人都有自己的私人司机。现在你甚至可以看到Uber的拼车服务正在取代穿梭巴士，因为这样更方便。然后你会买到摩托车，它们的市场份额更低。所以,你是对的。把富人曾经拥有的东西分发给所有人。

但是企业家的工作甚至在那之前就开始了，那就是创造。企业家精神本质上是一种从头开始创造新事物的行为。预测社会会需要它，然后想办法扩大它的规模，让它以一种有利可图的方式，以一种自我维持的方式，惠及每一个人。


9. **互联网极大地拓宽了职业发展的可能性**

互联网极大地拓宽了职业的可能空间，让你可以扩展任何痴迷成为利基。

## **互联网极大地拓宽了职业发展的可能空间**

尼维:我们来看下一条推特，我觉得这条推特很神秘，也很有趣，是关于你可能从事的工作或职业的。你说:“互联网极大地拓宽了职业发展的可能空间。大多数人还没有意识到这一点。”

纳瓦尔:互联网最基本的特点是它把地球上的每一个人联系在一起。你现在可以联系到每个人。

无论是给他们发私人邮件，还是在Twitter上向他们广播，还是在Facebook上发布他们发现的东西，还是建立一个他们来访问的网站。

它把每个人都联系起来。所以，互联网是一个互联互通的工具。它连接每一个人。这就是它的超级大国。你想用它。

可以帮助你弄明白的是，互联网意味着你可以为你的产品找到你的受众，或者你的才能和技能，不管他们离你有多远。

例如，Nenad，即Illacertus，如果你看看他在互联网出现之前的视频，你会发现他是如何传达信息的?他会怎么做?他会在他住的小区里跑来跑去，在电脑上或屏幕上给人看?或者他会尝试在他当地的电影院播放?这是不可能的。只有当他能把它放到网上时，它才会起作用。

那么世界上有多少人真正对它感兴趣呢?甚至对我们所谈论的内容感兴趣也会吸收它，对吧?这将是人类的一小部分。关键是能够接触到他们。

## **互联网允许你扩展任何痴迷成为利基**

所以，互联网所做的是允许**任何痴迷成为利基**，这可能是最奇怪的事情。可以是喜欢收集蛇的人，可以是喜欢骑热气球的人，可以是喜欢独自环游世界的人，可以是一个人在船上，也可以是一个痴迷于微型烹饪的人。日本有一种微型烹饪现象。或者有个节目是关于一个女人走进人们的房子，把它收拾干净，对吧?

所以，无论你痴迷于什么利基市场，互联网都能让你扩大规模。这并不是说你将打造下一个Facebook，或触及数十亿用户，但如果你只是想接触到5万名像你这样充满激情的人，就会有听众在等着你。

它的美妙之处在于地球上有70亿人口。人类DNA的组合是不可思议的。每个人都是完全不同的。你永远不会遇到任何两个人，甚至是模糊相似的对方，可以替代对方。

你不能说，“尼维，我刚离开我的生活。所以，我可以让另一个人进来，他就像尼维一样。我得到了同样的感觉，同样的反应，同样的想法。没有。人是没有替代品的。人是独一无二的。

所以，考虑到每个人都有不同的技能，不同的兴趣，不同的痴迷。正是这种多样性成为了创造力的超级力量。所以，每个人都可以在自己独特的事情上有创造性的高超。

但在互联网之前，这并不重要。因为如果你住在意大利的一个小渔村，就像你的渔村并不一定需要你完全独特的技能，你必须适应仅有的几份工作。但现在，你可以是完全独特的。

你可以上网，你可以找到你的观众。你可以建立一个企业，创造一个产品，创造财富，让人们快乐仅仅通过互联网独特地表达你自己。

职业的空间是如此的广阔。电子竞技选手，你知道，人们通过玩Fortnite赚了数百万美元。人们创建视频，然后上传。YouTube广播。博客、播客。乔·罗根，我读过，对或错，我不知道，但我读到他的播客每年能赚1亿美元。他的下载量达到了20亿次。

就连PewDiePie…前几天我也转发了一条搞笑的推特。PewDiePie是新闻中最受信任的名字。我想这是一个在瑞典的孩子，他拥有三倍于顶级有线新闻网络的发行量。就在他的新闻频道。甚至不在他的娱乐频道上。

## **通过真实性逃避竞争**

互联网使**任何痴迷成为利基**，只要你是最好的。好消息是每个人都是不同的，每个人在某方面都是最好的。做自己。

我的另一条推文很值得一写，但没有进入这场推文风暴，它很简单。我喜欢可以压缩的东西，因为它们很容易记住，也很容易挂在上面。但那句是“通过真实来逃避竞争”。

基本上，当你和别人竞争的时候，是因为你在模仿他们。因为你想做同样的事情。但每个人都是不同的。不要复制。

我知道我们是乐于模仿的生物，勒内·吉拉德有一个完整的模仿理论。但这要简单得多。不要模仿。不要复制。做你自己的事。没有人能和你竞争成为你自己。就是这么简单。

所以你对自己越真实，对你喜欢做的事情越真实，你就会有越少的竞争。所以，当你意识到没有人能在做自己的时候和你竞争时，你可以通过真实来逃避竞争。在互联网出现之前，这通常都是毫无用处的建议。后互联网时代，你可以把它变成一种职业。


10. **和值得长期交往的人玩长期的游戏**

选择一个你可以和长期伙伴一起玩长期游戏的行业。生活中所有的回报都来自于游戏中许多回合的复利。

## **和值得长期交往的人玩长期的游戏**

尼维:谈谈你应该考虑在哪些行业工作。你应该做什么样的工作?你想和谁一起工作?所以，你说，“一个人应该选择一个行业，在那里你可以和值得长期交往的人玩长期的游戏。为什么?

纳瓦尔:是的，这是对硅谷运作的洞察，也是对高信任度社会运作的洞察。从本质上说，生活中所有的好处都来自于复利。无论是在人际关系上，还是在赚钱上，还是在学习上。

因此，复利是一种神奇的力量，如果一开始你有1x，然后30年以每年20%的速度增长，你得到的不是30年乘以20%的增长。它是复合的，所以它一直在增长，一直增长，一直增长，直到你突然得到大量的它是什么。无论是善意、爱情、人际关系还是金钱。所以，我认为复利是一种非常重要的力量。

你必须能够打一场长期的比赛。长期博弈不仅有利于复利，也有利于信任。如果你看看囚徒困境类型的游戏，解决囚徒困境的方法就是以牙还牙，也就是我要像你上次对我做的那样，对你做一些原谅，以防你犯了错误。但这只适用于重复的囚徒困境，换句话说，如果我们玩了很多次游戏。

所以，如果你处在这样一种情况下，比如你在硅谷，在那里人们互相做生意，他们互相了解，互相信任。然后他们互相帮助，因为他们知道这个人会在下一场比赛中出现。

当然，这并不总是奏效，因为你可以在硅谷一举赚到那么多钱，有时人们会背叛彼此，因为他们会说，“我要靠这个赚到足够多的钱，我不在乎。”所以，所有这些情况都有例外。

但本质上，如果你想成功，你必须和其他人一起工作。你必须知道谁可以信任,谁你能相信,长时间的相信,你可以继续玩这个游戏,获得复利。 拥有高度信任,就能很容易地玩游戏,这会让你收集主要的奖励,在某个通常的周期。

例如,沃伦•巴菲特(Warren Buffett)所做的真的和美国股市的其他投资者一样,但他能做的最大的原因,是因为美国股市已经稳定,和周围其他元素，例如没有一个坏政府，或者美国没有卷入战争，底层平台没有被破坏。所以，对他来说，他是在玩一场长期的游戏。这种信任来自美国股市的稳定。

## **当你转行时，你是在从零开始**

在硅谷，信任来自于小地域内的人际网络，随着时间的推移，你会发现谁能与你共事，谁不能。

如果你不断地更换地点，你就不断地更换团队……比方说，你从木工行业起步，在那里建立了一个网络。你在努力工作，你在努力在木工行业制造产品。然后突然间，另一个行业出现了，它毗邻而异，但你并不真正了解其中的任何人，你想投入进去，在那里赚钱。

“不，实际上我需要开一条电动汽车加油站的线来给电动汽车加油。这或许有道理。这可能是最好的机会。但是每次你重置，每次你离开你建立网络的地方，你都要从头开始。你不知道该相信谁。他们也不会相信你的。

也有一些行业的人是流动的。他们总是进进出出。政治就是一个例子，对吧?在政治上，新当选的人正在当选。你可以在政治中看到，当你有很多老前辈的时候，比如参议院，他们已经存在很长时间了，他们是职业政客。

职业政客有很多缺点，比如腐败。但有利的一面是，他们确实能达成交易，因为他们知道，10年后，另一个人将处于同样的位置，他们将不得不继续与他们打交道，因此，他们不妨学习如何合作。

而每当你在众议院迎来新一届新生时，你要意识到众议院每两年就会举行一次大规模的选举。因为经常打架，他们什么事也做不了。“因为我刚来这里，我不认识你，我不知道你是否还在，我为什么要和你一起工作，而不是试着去做我认为正确的事情?”

所以，选择一个你可以长期参与游戏的行业，并与长期合作的人合作是很重要的。所以，这些人必须发出信号，表明他们将在这里待很长时间。他们关注伦理。他们的行为也体现了他们的道德观。

## **长期玩家使彼此富有**

尼维:**从长远来看，似乎每个人都在让彼此变得富有。从短期来看，似乎每个人都在让自己变得富有。**

纳瓦尔:我认为这是一个绝妙的构想。在长期博弈中，它是正和。我们一起烤馅饼。我们正努力使它尽可能大。在一个短期的游戏中，我们只是在切蛋糕。

这并不是社会主义者的借口，对吧?社会主义者是那些不参与烤馅饼的人，他们在最后出现，说，“我想要一块，或者我想要整个馅饼。“他们拿着枪出现了。

但我认为一个好的领导者是不会邀功的。一个好的领导者基本上是要激励员工，这样团队才能完成工作。然后事情就按照公平来分配了，谁贡献了多少，或者尽可能多的贡献，谁承担了风险，而不是谁有最长的刀，最锋利的刀。

## **收益来自迭代游戏的复利**

尼维:接下来的两条推文是“玩迭代游戏”。生活中的所有回报，无论是财富、人际关系还是知识，都来自复利。”

纳瓦尔:当你和某人做生意的时候，你已经和某人做了十年、二十年、三十年的朋友，因此你很容易就信任他们，所以关系会越来越好。摩擦减小了，你们可以一起做越来越大的事情。

举个例子，最简单的就是和某人结婚，生孩子，抚养孩子。这是复利，对吧? 在这些关系上投资。与更随意的关系相比，这些关系最终是无价的。

在健康和健身方面也是如此。你知道，你越健康，就越容易保持健康。然而，你的身体状况越差，就越难恢复，也就越难爬回基准线。它需要英勇的行为。

尼维:关于复利，我想我刚才看到有人转发了。也许是Ed Latimore写的。大概是这样的:“获得一些牵引力。[更正:这条推文的作者是@mmay3r]。所以，我们的想法是获得一些最初的牵引力，永远不要后退，只是不断地往上爬，再往上爬。

纳瓦尔:我不太记得了。但我认为这是对的。是的，那就像，“抓住牵引力，不要松手。”“不错，不错。


11. **选择聪明、精力充沛、正直的****伙伴**

挑选聪明、精力充沛、为人正直的伴侣是你不能妥协的清。

## **选择高智商、精力充沛和正直的商业伙伴**

纳瓦尔:在挑选同事方面，挑选那些高智商、精力充沛、正直的人，我发现这是你不能妥协的条件。

你需要一个聪明的人，否则他们会误入歧途。你最终不会达到目的。

你需要一个精力充沛的人，因为这个世界充满了聪明、懒惰的人。在我们的生活中，我们都认识一些非常聪明的人，但是他们却下不了床，也动不了一根手指。我们也知道有些人精力充沛，但并不那么聪明。是的，他们努力工作，但他们在朝着错误的方向前进。而smart并不是一个贬义词。这并不是说有人聪明，有人愚蠢。但重要的是，每个人在不同的事情上都很聪明。所以，取决于你想做好什么，你必须找到在这方面很聪明的人。

然后是精力，很多时候人们对某件事情没有动力，但是他们对其他事情有动力。例如，有些人可能真的没有动力去工作，坐在办公室里。但他们可能真的有动力去画画，对吧?

嗯，如果是那样的话，他们应该是画家。他们应该把艺术作品放到网上。努力想办法以此为基础建立自己的事业，而不是戴着领带去做一份枯燥的工作。

最后，正直是最重要的，否则，如果他有另外两个优点，你就会遇到一个聪明、勤奋的骗子，他最终会欺骗你。所以，你必须弄清楚这个人是否诚实。

就像我们说过的，你要做的是通过信号判断。信号是他们做什么，而不是他们说什么。当他们认为没有人在看的时候，他们会做一些和说的有所不同的事情。

## **动力必须来自内在**

尼维:关于动力,这有个有趣的关于山姆奥特曼的事,他谈到代表团时,他说:“代表团的重要的事情之一,代表实际上是擅长你想让他们做的事情。”

这是最显而易见的事情，但似乎……你想要和那些自愿做你想让他们做的事情的人合作。

纳瓦尔:是的。如果我认为他们不喜欢我想让他们做的事情，我几乎不会创办一家公司，不会雇人，也不会和他们一起工作。

当我年轻的时候，我常常试着说服人们去做一些事情。我有个想法，你可以说服别人做点什么。但是你真的可以么? 你无法让他们始终保持动力。你可以从一开始就启发他们。如果你是一个像亨利五世那样的国王，你想让他们冲锋陷阵，然后他们就会想出办法回避。

如果你想让某人保持长期的动力，这种动力必须来自内在。你不能只是创造它，如果他们没有内在的动力，你也不能成为他们的拐杖。所以，你必须确保人们精力充沛，想做你想让他们做的事，想和他们一起工作。

## **诚信是一个人做什么，不是他们说什么**

读取信号是非常非常重要的。信号是人们说什么做什么。所以，注意细微的信号是很重要的。我们都知道，在社交场合，如果有人对服务员非常不好，那么他们对你不好只是时间问题。

如果有人压制了一个敌人，并对他们怀恨在心，那么他们把你从朋友重新定义为敌人只是时间问题，你会感受到他们的愤怒。因此，愤怒、愤怒、报复、短视的人在现实生活中的许多互动中本质上都是这样的。

人其实出奇地一致。这是你会从生活中学到的一件事。所以，你想找到长期的伙伴。你想要找到那些似乎具备非理性道德的人。

举个例子，我有个朋友，他的公司是我投资的，但是公司倒闭了，他本可以把所有的投资者都赶尽杀绝。但是他不断地投入越来越多的个人资金。通过三个不同的支点，他投入了个人资金，直到公司最终成功。在这个过程中，他从未消灭过投资者。

对此我一直很感激他。我说，“哇，你对投资者这么好真是太棒了。你没有消灭他们。他对此很生气。他说:“我不是为你做的。我这么做不是为了我的投资者。我是为了我自己。这是我自己的自尊。这就是我关心的。这就是我的生活。“这就是你想要共事的那种人。

另一个我喜欢的引用的推特，其实我有一条关于这个的推特。我想我在别的地方读过这篇文章，所以我不认为这是我的功劳。但是我稍微修改了一下。也就是说“自尊是你对自己的声誉。“你总会知道的。

好人，有道德的人，容易相处的人，可靠的人，往往有很高的自尊。因为他们希望自己有很好的声誉，他们明白这一点。

这不是自我。自尊和自我是两码事。因为自我可能是不值得的，但自尊至少让你觉得自己遵守了自己内心的道德准则。

因此，和那些最终必定会变得不诚实的人一起工作是非常困难的。很难区分谁是高级别的正直，谁是低级别的正直。一般来说，一个人对道德、伦理和正直谈论的越多，他们就越不可能成为那样的人。

这很像地位信号。如果你公然追求地位，如果你公然谈论高地位，那就是低地位的举动。如果你公开谈论自己有多诚实、可靠和值得信赖，你可能就没有那么诚实和值得信赖了。因为这是骗子的特点。

所以，必须选择一个你可以长期相处的伙伴，选择一起玩长期游戏的行业。


12. **与理性乐观主义者合作**

不要与愤世嫉俗者和悲观主义者为伍。他们的信念会自我实现的。

## **不要和悲观主义者合作**

尼维:最后一条推特。你说过，“不要与愤世嫉俗者和悲观主义者为伍。他们的信念是会自我实现的。”

纳瓦尔:是的。本质上，要创造事物，你必须是一个理性乐观主义者。理性的意思是你必须看清世界的本质。但你必须对自己的能力保持乐观，对自己完成任务的能力保持乐观。

我们都知道有些人总是很悲观，他们会否定一切。每个人的生活中都遇到过乐于助人的批判性的人，对吧? 他认为自己很有帮助，但实际上他很挑剔，对任何事情都很悲观。

这个人不仅不会在生活中做任何伟大的事情，他们还会阻止周围的人做一些伟大的事情。他们认为他们的工作就是把东西打破。只要你能想出一个解决方案，你就可以把事情搞砸。

还有一句经典的军事台词，“要么领导，要么跟随，要么滚开。”“这些人想要第四种选择，他们不想领导，不想跟随，但又不想让路。他们想告诉你为什么这事行不通。

我认识的所有真正成功的人都有很强的行动偏执。他们只是做事。判断某件事是否可行的最简单方法是做这件事。至少做第一步，第二步，第三步，然后决定。

所以，如果你想在生活中取得成功，创造财富，或拥有良好的人际关系，或保持健康，甚至是快乐，你需要对得到你想要的东西有一种行动偏执。

## **与理性乐观主义者合作**

你必须对此保持乐观。这并非不合理。你知道，没有什么比一个莽撞的人追逐不值得的东西更糟糕的了。

这就是为什么我说理性乐观主义者。你必须理性。了解所有的陷阱。知道它的缺点，但仍要保持乐观。

你在这个星球上只有一次生命。为什么不试着做点大事情呢?这就是埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)的魅力所在。我认为他激励了这么多人的原因，只是因为他承担了非常、非常大胆的任务。他为人们树立了一个远大理想的榜样。

即使是很小的东西，也需要做很多工作。我不认为街角杂货店的老板比埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)工作更努力，也不认为他为此付出的汗水和辛劳更少。甚至杂货老板做的更多。

但是无论出于什么原因，教育，环境，他们没有机会去想那么多，所以结果并不那么大。所以，最好是想得远一点。显然，理性地，在你的能力范围内，保持乐观。

愤世嫉俗者和悲观主义者，他们真正想说的是，这很不幸，他们基本上是在说，“我已经放弃了。我想我什么也做不了。所以对我来说，这个世界就像一个没有人能做任何事的世界。所以你为什么要去做一些事情，因为如果你失败了，那么我是对的，这很好。但如果你成功了，那你只会让我看起来很糟糕。”

## **我们是悲观主义者的后代**

尼维:对，做一个非理性的乐观主义者可能比做一个理性的愤世嫉俗者更好。

纳瓦尔:对于为什么你应该成为一个乐观主义者，有一个完全理性的解释框架。历史上，如果你回到2000年，5000年，10000年，两个人在丛林中漫步，他们听到了老虎的叫声。一个是乐观主义者，他说，“哦，它没有朝我们这边来。另一个说:“我是个悲观主义者，我要离开这里。”悲观主义者逃跑而幸存，乐观主义者被吃掉。

所以，我们是悲观主义者的后代。我们天生就是悲观主义者。但现代社会要安全得多。没有老虎在街上游荡。虽然你应该避免彻底破产，但你最终不太可能彻底破产。

更有可能的情况是，上涨是无限的，下跌是有限的。因此，适应现代社会意味着你要克服悲观情绪，做出有点不理性的乐观押注，因为如果你开创下一个SpaceX、特斯拉或优步(Uber)，你可以为社会和自己创造数十亿美元的价值，并改变世界。

如果你失败了，有什么大不了的? 你损失了几百万美元的投资者资金，而投资者还有很多，他们会继续把赌注押在你成功的机会上。

过去悲观是有道理的。同样今天保持乐观是有意义的，尤其是如果你受过教育，生活在第一世界国家。甚至是第三世界国家也一样。我认为第三世界国家的经济机会要大得多。

你必须避免的一件事是破产的风险。毁灭意味着远离监狱。所以，不要做任何违法的事情。穿橙色连身衣从来都不值得。远离灾难性的损失。这可能意味着你远离那些对身体有害的事情，不要伤害你的身体。

你必须注意你的健康。远离那些会让你失去所有资本和储蓄的事情。所以，不要孤注一掷。但要理性乐观，押注股市大幅上涨。

## **BOCTAO**

尼维:我认为有些人会尝试实践你的想法，建立在你的想法之上，不管这些想法看起来多么牵强。还有人列出了所有明显的例外，不管它们有多明显。

幸运的是，在创业的世界里，我甚至没有真正接触到那些给你带来明显例外的人，也没有接触到所有这些行不通的原因。我很少再接触这些了。

纳瓦尔:这就是Twitter的作用。斯科特·亚当斯对此非常恼火，他想出了一个短语，一个缩略语，“当然也有明显的例外”，boctao。他曾经有一段时间把这个缩写词钉在文章的末尾。

但是推特上到处都是吹毛求疵的人。然而，正如你所指出的，硅谷已经认识到，这样做的好处是如此之大，以至于你永远不会看不起一个穿着连帽衫、鞋上沾着咖啡的孩子。哪怕他看起来像个懒汉。因为你不知道他会成为下一个马克·扎克伯格，还是下一个里德·霍夫曼。

所以，你必须尊重每一个人。你必须寻找每一种可能性，每一个机会，因为在现代世界中，好处是无限的，坏处是有限的，尤其是在金融资产和金融工具方面。


13. **用特殊知识武装自己**

用特殊知识武装自己。它不是训练出来的，但它可以通过追求你真正的好奇心来发现。

## **用特殊知识武装自己**

尼维:你想谈谈你需要的技能吗，尤其是特殊的知识、责任感、影响力和判断力。因此，这方面的第一条推文是“用特殊的知识、责任和影响力武装自己”。“我还要加上判断。我不认为你在那篇推文中提到了这一点。

纳瓦尔:如果你想赚钱，你必须按比例获得报酬。为什么是你，这就是问责制，在规模上，这就是杠杆，你得到报酬而不是其他人得到报酬，这就是特殊的知识。

所以，特殊的知识可能是整个推特风暴中最难传达的东西，这可能是人们最困惑的事情。

问题是，我们有这样的想法，一切都可以教，一切都可以在学校教。并不是所有的东西都可以教。事实上，最有趣的东西是不能教的。但一切都是可以学会的。要么来自一些先天特征，来自你的DNA,或者也可以通过你的童年,你学到的特殊软技能,很难在以后的生活中教,或者它是崭新的，所以没人知道怎么做。或者的确在工作中培训出来，因为你d的模式匹配某个高度复杂的环境,基本上在一个特定的领域建立了直觉判断。

经典的例子是投资，但它可以是在任何领域。它可以是对一个车队的判断，也可以是对天气预报的判断。

所以，特殊知识就是你所关心的知识。尤其是如果你在以后的人生中，比如说你的20、21、22岁，你几乎没有机会选择你拥有哪些特殊知识。相反，您可以查看在那个时间点之前已经构建了什么，然后可以在此基础上构建。

## **特殊知识是无法训练的**

关于特殊知识，首先要注意的是，你无法为此接受培训。如果你能接受培训，如果你能去上课学习特殊知识，那么其他人也能接受培训，然后我们就能大规模生产和培训人才。见鬼，我们甚至可以给电脑编程，最终我们还可以给机器人编程，让它们四处走动。

所以，如果是这样的话，那么你是非常可替代的，我们付给你的就是最低工资，我们付给你的工资是为了让你去做这件事，而其他很多人都可以接受培训来做这件事。所以，你的回报就是你的培训成本加上培训的投资回报。

所以，你真的想要学习特殊知识，你需要你的学校教育，你需要你的训练来利用最好的特定知识，但是你能得到报酬的部分是特殊知识。

## **特殊知识是通过追求你的好奇心而发现的**

比如，一个人拿到了心理学学位，然后成为了一名销售员。如果他们已经是一个强大的销售人员，一个高水平的销售技巧开始，那么心理学学位是杠杆，它武装他们，让他们在销售上做得更好。

但如果他们天生是一个内向的人，从来都不擅长销售，他们试图用心理学来学习销售，他们就不会那么擅长。

因此，通过追求你的天赋、你真正的好奇心和你的激情，你会发现更多的具体知识。不是为了最热门的工作去上学，也不是为了进入投资者认为最热门的领域。

通常特殊知识处于知识的边缘。它也是一些刚刚被算出来或者很难算出来的东西。

所以，如果你不是100%的投入，其他人会比你做得更好。他们不仅会比你多一点点，他们会比你多很多。因为在经营理念的领域，复利和杠杆确实适用。

所以,如果你操作1000倍杠杆，80%的时间是正确的人当然不如90%的时间是正确的人。真的，市场会支付数百倍给后者，因为杠杆和复利更高。所以，你必须确保你很擅长某件事，所以真正的好奇心是非常重要的。

## **建立特殊知识对你来说就像玩耍**

所以，很多时候，这不是你坐下来思考的事情，更多的是通过观察发现的。你要回顾你自己的生活，看看你到底擅长什么。

例如，我想成为一名科学家，这就是我的很多道德思考的来源。我认为科学家处于人类生产力链条的顶端。这群科学家做出了真正的突破和贡献，我认为他们对人类社会的贡献可能比任何其他阶层的人都要大。

不是要说艺术、政治、工程或商业不重要，但如果没有科学，我们仍然会在泥土中挣扎，用棍棒打架，试图点火。

我的整个价值体系是围绕科学家建立的，我想成为一名伟大的科学家。但当我真正回头看我特别擅长什么以及我最终花时间做什么时，更多的是围绕着赚钱、摆弄技术和向人们推销东西。解释事情，和人们交谈。

所以，我有一些销售技巧，这是一种形式的特殊知识，我有。我有一些关于如何赚钱的分析技巧。我有这种能力去吸收数据，对它着迷，并把它分解，这是我的一项特殊技能。我也喜欢摆弄技术。所有这些对我来说都像是玩耍，但对其他人来说却像是工作。

所以，对其他人来说，这些事情会很难，他们会说，“好吧，我怎么才能变得擅长简洁和推销想法呢?“嗯，如果你还不擅长做某件事，或者你对它不感兴趣，也许那不是你的专长，那就专注于你真正感兴趣的事情。

这很讽刺，但是第一个真正指出我的具体知识的人是我的母亲。她在厨房边说边做，我15、16岁的时候她就这么说了。我告诉我的一个朋友，我想成为一名天体物理学家，她说:“不，你要去经商。”

我说，“什么，我妈妈说我要去做生意。我要成为一名天体物理学家。妈妈不知道她在说什么。但是妈妈知道她在说什么。

她已经注意到，每次我们走在街上，我都会批评当地的披萨店，为什么他们要用特定的配料以特定的方式出售披萨，为什么他们点披萨的过程是那样的，而实际上应该是这样的。

所以，她知道我对商业更有好奇心，但后来，我对科学的痴迷结合起来，创造了科技和我发现自己所在的科技企业。

所以，通常情况下，你的具体知识会被了解你的人观察到，而且经常是被了解你的人观察到的，他们会在某些情况下揭示你的知识，而不是你想出来的东西。


14. **特殊知识是高度创造性的或技术性的**

特殊知识往往是创造性的或技术性的。它处于技术、艺术和交流的最前沿。

## **特殊知识可以通过学徒制度来传授**

纳瓦尔:就教授的具体知识而言，这是工作。它通过学徒制传授。这就是为什么最好的企业，最好的职业是学徒或自学成才的职业，因为这些都是社会还没有弄清楚如何培训和自动化的东西。

最经典的一句话是，沃伦•巴菲特(Warren Buffett)毕业后去找本杰明•格雷厄姆(Benjamin Graham)。本杰明·格雷厄姆是《聪明的投资者》一书的作者，他将现代价值投资作为一门学科。沃伦·巴菲特找到本杰明·格雷厄姆，免费为他工作。

格雷厄姆说，“实际上，你的价格太高了，免费就是太高了。格雷厄姆完全正确。当谈到一个非常宝贵的学徒期，就像格雷厄姆要给巴菲特的那种，巴菲特应该给他很多钱。它告诉你这些技能是值得拥有的。

## **特殊知识往往具有高度的创造性或技术性**

特殊知识也往往是技术性的和创造性的。它在技术的前沿，在艺术的前沿，在交流的前沿。

例如，即使在今天，互联网上也可能有一些模式大王，他们可以创造出令人难以置信的模式，将这个想法传播给数百万人。或者很有说服力——斯科特·亚当斯就是一个很好的例子。他通过有说服力的论据和视频做出了准确的预测，正从本质上成为世界上最可信的人之一。

这依赖特殊知识,他已经建立了多年。因为他沉迷于催眠，他年轻的时候学会了如何沟通--通过漫画,他接受了早期Periscope的媒体。所以他练习大量的对话,他阅读所有的关于这个话题的书籍,他的工作就是他的日常生活。如果你看看他的女朋友，她是一个年轻漂亮的Instagram模特。

这是一个在职业生涯中积累了特定知识的人的例子。它极具创造性，其中有技术元素，而且永远不会被自动化。

没人能从他身上夺走这一点，因为他也以斯科特·亚当斯(Scott Adams)这个品牌负责任，他利用Periscope的媒体影响力，画呆伯特漫画，写书。他在这个品牌上拥有巨大的影响力，如果他想在现有财富的基础上创造更多的财富，他可以利用这个品牌积累财富。

## **特殊知识是具体到个人情况的**

尼维:我们应该称它为独特的知识，还是特殊知识更有意义?

纳瓦尔:你知道，我在很小的时候就提出了这个框架。我们谈了几十年。现在它可能有30多年的历史了。所以，在那个时候，特殊知识一直伴随着我。这就是我对它的看法。

我没有尝试去改变它的原因,是因为我发现它的每一项都以不同的方式超载了。至少如果不用特殊知识，我可以给它换个称呼。

独特知识的问题是，是的，也许它是独特的，但如果我从别人那里学来的，它的独特时间更长，那么我们都知道。所以，并不是说它是独一无二的，而是它是高度特定于具体情况的，它是特定于个人的，它是特定于问题的，它只能被视为一个更大的痴迷，兴趣和花在那个领域的时间的一部分。

它不能直接从一本书里读出来，也不能在一门课里教出来，也不能被编程成一个算法。

## **你不能太刻意地去收集特殊知识**

尼维:说到斯科特·亚当斯，他有一篇博客文章，讲的是如何通过在三件或三件以上的事情上进入前25%，来建立自己的职业生涯。通过这样做，你会成为世界上唯一一个能做到这三件事的人。

所以，不要试图在一件事上做到最好，你只要在三件或三件以上的事情上做到非常非常好。这是建立特定知识的一种方式吗?

纳瓦尔:实际上，我认为最好的方法就是追随自己的爱好。在你内心深处的某个地方，你可以意识到，事实上，我喜欢这种痴迷，我会留意它的商业方面。

但我认为，如果你过于刻意地去建立它，如果你过于以金钱为目标，那么你就不会选择正确的东西。你不会真正选择你喜欢做的事情，所以你不会深入其中。

基于统计数据，斯科特•亚当斯(Scott Adams)的观察很好。假设有10000个领域对今天的人类来说是有价值的就知识而言，在这10000个领域中排名第一。

在这10000人中，每个人都有可能成为第一，除非你恰好是世界上对某件事最着迷的10000个人之一。

但是当你开始把3728号领域和你顶尖的销售技巧，优秀的写作技巧，或者对会计和金融非常了解的人结合起来的时候，当对这个交集的需求到来的时候，你已经从10000个领域通过组合扩展到了数百万甚至数千万交叉点。因此，竞争就会大大减弱。

而且，回报也在递减。所以，在三到四件事上成为前5%的人比在某件事上成为第一要容易得多。

## **在你天生擅长的领域建立特殊知识**

我认为这是一种非常务实的做法。但我认为重要的是，不要刻意地组装东西，因为你确实想选择你天生爱好的东西。每个人都有天生的才能。

我们都很熟悉这个短语，a natural。“哦，这个人很自然地会见男人或女人，这个人是天生的社会名流，这个人是天生的程序员，这个人是天生的读者。所以，无论你天生擅长什么，你都想加倍努力。

可能还有很多事情是你天生擅长的。因为性格和人类是非常复杂的。所以，我们希望能够把你天生擅长的东西结合起来，这样你就能自然而然地，仅仅通过纯粹的兴趣和享受，在很多事情上达到前25%或前10%或前5%的水平。然后借助组合，成为世界第一。


# **15. 学会销售，学会建造**

学习销售。学会建立。如果你两者都能做到，你将势不可挡。

## **学会销售，学会建造**

尼维:谈到综合技能，你说过你应该“学会销售，学会建造，如果你能两者兼顾，你将势不可挡。”

纳瓦尔:这是一个非常广泛的类别。这是两大类。其中之一是开发产品。这很难，而且是多元的。它可以包括设计，可以包括开发，可以包括制造，物流，采购，甚至可以设计和运营服务。它有很多定义。

但在每个行业，都有一个建造者的定义。在我们的科技行业，这是技术总监，这是程序员，这是软件工程师，硬件工程师。但即使在洗衣行业，也可能是建立洗衣服务的人，让火车准时运行的人，确保所有的衣服在正确的时间出现在正确的地方的人，等等。

另一方面是销售。同样，销售有一个非常宽泛的定义。销售并不一定意味着销售个人客户，但它可以意味着营销，它可以意味着沟通，它可以意味着招聘，它可以意味着筹集资金，它可以意味着鼓舞人心，它可以意味着做公关。

## **硅谷模式是一个建造者和销售者组成的**

所以，总的来说，硅谷的创业模式往往是最好的。这不是唯一的方法，但可能是最常见的方法，当你有两个创始人，其中一个是世界级的销售人员，另一个是世界级的建筑人员。

例子是,当然,史蒂夫·乔布斯和史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克,苹果,盖茨和艾伦在早期可能有类似的责任，微软,拉里和谢尔盖可能沿着这条线,虽然有点不同,因为这是一个非常技术的产品，交付给最终用户，通过一个简单的接口。

但一般来说，你会看到这种模式反复出现。有一个建筑商，也有一个销售者。有CEO和CTO的组合。风险投资者和技术投资者几乎都受过训练，只要有可能就会寻找这种组合。这就是神奇的组合。

## **如果你两者都能做到，你将势不可挡**

最终的结果是一个人可以同时做到这两件事。只有这样你才能获得真正的超能力。那时你就能找到可以创造整个行业的人才。

埃隆•马斯克(Elon Musk)就是活生生的例子。他可能没有必要亲自建造火箭，但他足够了解，他实际上做出了技术上的贡献。他对这项技术非常了解，没有人会对他说三道四，他也不会到处宣称自己不认为自己最终无法实现目标。他可能对时间表持乐观态度，但他认为这是合理的。

甚至史蒂夫·乔布斯也发展了足够的产品技能，并对产品投入了足够的精力，他在这两个领域都有所作为。拉里·埃里森一开始是一个程序员，我想他写了甲骨文的第一个版本，或者说是积极参与其中。

马克·安德森也在这个范畴。他可能对自己的销售技巧没有足够的信心，但他是网景导航仪(Netscape Navigator)的程序员。所以，我认为在任何领域真正的巨人是那些既能建造又能销售的人。

## **我宁愿教工程师市场营销，也不愿教营销工程师工程学**

通常情况下，这栋楼是销售人员在以后的生活中拿不到的东西。这需要太多专注的时间。但建筑者可以在稍晚些时候开始销售，尤其是如果他们天生就擅长沟通的话。比尔•盖茨(Bill Gates)有句名言是这样解释的:“我宁愿教工程师营销，也不愿教营销工程师工程学。”

我认为如果你打算学习建筑技能,还是尽早在你的职业生涯,或者你有足够的集中时间时进行,你可以以后学习销售,如果你有一些天分或你是一个好的销售人员,你可以让成就翻番。

现在，你的销售技能可能在一个不同于传统领域。例如，假设你是一个很好的工程师，然后人们说，现在你需要擅长销售，你可能不擅长直接销售，但你可能是一个很好的作家。

写作是一种比面对面销售更容易学习的技能，所以你可以培养写作技能，直到你成为一名优秀的在线交流者，然后将其用于你的销售。

另一方面，你可能是一个很好的建设者，但你不擅长写作，你不喜欢和大众交流，但你擅长一对一的交流，所以你可以用你的销售技巧来招聘或筹款，这是更多的一对一的努力。

这是指出如果你处在这两个交点的价值,因为你也许不是最好的技术专家，你也许不是最好的销售人员,但在一个奇怪组合方式上,回到刚才谈过的斯科特·亚当斯的说法,结合两个技能，你就是不可阻挡的。

从长远来看，那些了解潜在产品的人，知道如何制造和销售产品的人，对投资者来说就像猫咬草一样，如果他们有足够的精力，他们可以打破传统障碍，他们几乎可以做成任何事情。

尼维:如果你只能选一个擅长的，你会选哪一个?

纳瓦尔:建筑。当你试图从各种噪音建筑中脱颖而出时，其实更好。因为有太多的骗子和销售人员，他们没有任何支持。当你开始创业的时候，当你想要被认可的时候，建筑会更好。

但之后的建设会变得很累，因为这是一项专注的工作，很难保持与时俱进，因为总会有新的人，新产品出现，他们有更新的工具，而且坦白说，会有更多的时间，因为这是一项非常紧张、非常专注的任务。

所以，随着时间的推移，销售技巧实际上会变得更好。例如，如果你有一个建立一个伟大的产品的声誉，这是好的，但当你推出你的新产品，我将验证它的基础上的产品。但是，如果你有一个很好的商业合作伙伴的声誉，而且你很有说服力，善于沟通，那么这个声誉几乎会自我实现。

所以，我认为如果你只需要选一个，你可以从建立开始，然后过渡到销售。这是一个看起来有点像逃避的答案，但我认为这实际上是正确的答案。
# **16.读你喜欢的书，直到你喜欢****阅读**

你应该能够拿起图书馆里的任何一本书来读。

## **读你喜欢的书，直到你喜欢阅读为止**

尼维:在我们开始讨论问责制、影响力和判断力之前，你已经有了一些推文，我会把它们归入持续学习的范畴。

他们本质上是，“没有所谓的商业技能。避开商业杂志和商业课程，学习微观经济学、博弈论、心理学、说服力、伦理学、数学和计算机。”

还有一个你做的评论是，“你应该能够在图书馆里拿起任何一本书来读。这类推文的最后一条是，“阅读比倾听快，行动比观看快。”

纳瓦尔:对，这方面最重要的一条推文，不幸的是，我这里甚至没有提到，那就是，学习的基础是阅读。我认识的聪明人中，没有一个不经常读书的。

问题是，我读什么?我怎么读书?因为对大多数人来说，这是一种挣扎，一种苦差事。所以，最重要的是学会如何教育自己，而教育自己的方法就是培养对阅读的热爱。

所以，这条推特被省略了，我的意思是，“读你喜欢的，直到你喜欢读为止。”“就是这么简单。

我认识的每一个爱读书的人都喜欢读书，他们喜欢读书是因为他们读他们喜欢的书。这有点像第二十二条军规，但你基本上想从阅读开始，无论你在哪里，然后不断积累，直到阅读成为一种习惯。最终，你会对这些简单的东西感到厌烦。

所以你可能开始读小说,然后可能科幻小说,然后可能非小说类,然后可能研究科学或哲学,数学或者不管它是什么,但按照你的自然路径，读你感兴趣的东西,直到你理解他们。然后你会很自然地进入下一件事，下一件事，再下一件事。

## **阅读某个领域的原始科学文献**

有一个例外，那就是我在暗示你真正想学的东西是什么，也就是说，在某一时刻，有太多的东西可供阅读。甚至阅读也充满了垃圾。

事实上，你可以阅读一些东西，尤其是在早期，这些东西会以某种方式对你的大脑进行编程，之后你读到的东西，你会根据早期的东西来判断这些东西是对的还是错的。

所以，阅读基础知识是很重要的。我想说的是，基础性的东西，是某一特定领域的原创书籍，其本质是非常科学的。

例如，不要读商业书籍，拿起亚当·斯密的《国富论》。我不会读一本今天写的关于生物学或进化论的书，而是会读达尔文的《物种起源》。我现在不去读一本关于生物技术的书，那可能是一本非常先进的书。你可以从理查德·费曼(Richard Feynman)的《六件简单的事》(Six Easy Pieces)开始，从基础物理学开始，而不是读宇宙学、尼尔·德格拉斯·泰森(Neil Degrasse Tyson)和斯蒂芬·霍金(Stephen Hawking)一直在说的那些高级著作。

## **不要害怕任何一本书**

如果你了解基础知识，尤其是数学、物理和科学，那么你就不会害怕任何一本书。我们所有人都有这样的记忆，当我们坐在教室里学习数学的时候，这一切都是合乎逻辑的，都是有意义的，直到有一天，教室移动得太快，我们落在了后面。

在那之后，我们就只能背方程，背概念而不能从基本原理推导出它们。在那一刻，我们迷失了，因为除非你是一个专业的数学家，否则你不会记住那些东西。你要记住的只是技巧和基础。

所以，你必须确保你建立在一个框架的理解之上，因为你正在为摩天大楼打好基础，你不只是在记忆东西，因为你只是在记忆你丢失的东西。所以基础非常重要。

最重要的是，最重要的是当你走进一个图书馆，你上下打量它，你不会害怕任何一本书。你知道你可以取任何书，从书架上取书,你可以阅读它,你可以理解,你可以吸收正确的,你可以拒绝假的,你甚至有一个基础,是合理的和科学的,而不是纯粹基于意见。

## **学习的手段是丰富的，学习的欲望是稀缺的**

互联网的美丽之处在于，比整个亚历山大图书馆大10倍的知识随时触手可及。不是教育手段或学习手段稀缺，学习手段丰富。缺乏的是学习的欲望。所以，你必须培养这种欲望。

甚至不是培养，而是不失去它。孩子们有天生的好奇心。如果你去找一个刚开始学语言的小孩，他们总是问:这是什么?那是什么?这是为什么呢?那是谁?他们总是问问题。

但是，学校和我们的教育体系，甚至我们抚养孩子的方式，用顺从取代了好奇。一旦你用顺从取代好奇，你就会得到一个顺从的工厂工人，但你不再会得到一个创造性的思考者。你需要创造力，你需要让你自己的大脑去学习任何你想学的东西。

# **17.数学和逻辑****是基础**

如果你懂数学和逻辑，你就有了理解其他一切的基础。

## **你的终极基础是数学和逻辑**

纳瓦尔:基本的东西是原则，它们是算法，它们是根深蒂固的逻辑理解，你可以从任何角度保护它或攻击它。这就是为什么微观经济学很重要，因为宏观经济学需要大量的记忆，其实就是大量的宏观废话。

正如纳西姆•塔勒布(Nassim Taleb)所说，宏观上的胡扯比微观上的胡扯更容易。因为宏观经济学是一门复杂的学科——科学与政治相遇。如今，你找不到两位宏观经济学家在任何事情上意见一致，不同的政治家利用不同的宏观经济学家兜售他们各自钟爱的理论。

现在甚至有宏观经济学家在兜售所谓的现代货币理论，也就是说，除了讨厌的通货膨胀，我们可以印我们想要的所有货币。是的，除了讨厌的通货膨胀。这就像说，除了有限的能量，我们可以发射火箭进入太空一整天。

这简直是一派胡言，但事实是，有些人在他们的头衔中写着“宏观经济学家”，并兜售现代货币理论，这只是告诉你，宏观经济学作为一门所谓的科学已经堕落了。它现在是政治的一个分支。

所以，你要把重点放在基础上。最终的基础是数学和逻辑。如果你理解逻辑和数学，那么你就有了理解科学方法的基础。一旦你理解了科学方法，你就能理解如何在其他领域和其他你正在阅读的东西中区分真伪。

## **慢慢地读一本好书要比快速地浏览一百本书要好**

所以，在阅读别人的观点时要非常小心，甚至在阅读事实时也要小心，因为所谓的事实往往只是表面上的(伪科学)观点。

你真正需要的是算法/计算。你真正需要的是理解。慢慢地读完一本书，挣扎着，跌跌撞撞，倒带回去，而不要飞快地读完，然后说:“我已经读了20本书，我已经读了30本书，我已经在这个领域读了50本书。”

就像李小龙说的，“我不害怕知道一千种踢腿和一千种打腿的人，我害怕的是练习过一拳一万次或一脚一万次的人。”“正是通过重复、使用、逻辑和基础的理解，让你成为一个聪明的思考者。”

## **学会说服和编程**

尼维:如果我要总结一下的话，我认为你需要两件事来为你的余生打下学习的基础。第一，实践说服；第二，你需要深入了解一些技术范畴，无论是抽象数学，还是唐纳德·努斯关于算法的书，还是费曼关于物理的讲座。

如果你有实际的说服力，对一些复杂的话题有深刻的理解，我认为你的余生将有一个很好的学习基础。

纳瓦尔:是的。我把它展开一点。我认为五个最重要的技能是：阅读，写作，算术，然后加上说服，也就是说话。最后，我要加上计算机编程，因为它是一种应用形式的算术，让你在任何领域都能自由发挥作用。

如果你擅长电脑，如果你擅长基础数学，如果你擅长写作，如果你擅长说话，如果你喜欢阅读，你就已经为生活做好了准备。

# **18.没有所谓的“商业”技能**

没有一种技能叫做商业。避开商学院和杂志。

## 没有所谓的“商业”技能

纳瓦尔:从这个意义上说，生意对我来说是最重要的。没有一种的技能叫做商业，它太普通了。这就像一种叫做“建立联系”的技能。就像“Like”与人类有关。“这不是一项技能，它太宽泛了。

商学院里发生了很多事情，商学院里也教授一些非常聪明的东西——我并不是说完全否定它们——不过商学院里教授的一些东西只是一些轶事。他们称之为“案例研究”。

但它们只是一些趣闻轶事，它们试图通过向你抛出大量数据点来帮助你进行模式匹配，但事实是，你永远不会完全理解它们，除非你自己也处于这种状态。

即使到那时，你也会发现博弈论、心理学、伦理学、数学、计算机和逻辑学的基本概念会对你大有裨益。

我会专注于基础，专注于科学。我会爱上阅读，包括阅读那些你不应该读的垃圾读物。你不需要读经典。读书是自我教育的基础。

## 做比看快

尼维:你说“做的比看的快”是什么意思?

纳瓦尔:说到你的学习曲线，如果你想优化你的学习曲线，我不喜欢播客的原因之一就是，即使我是播客的创造者，我也喜欢快速地消化我的信息。

我是一个很好的读者，或者快速的读者，我可以读得很快，但是我只能以一定的速度听。我知道人们听音乐的速度是2倍，3倍，但每个人听起来都像一只花栗鼠，很难再听一遍，很难突出显示，很难找出片段并保存在笔记本上，等等。

同样的，很多人认为他们可以通过观察别人做某件事，甚至通过阅读别人做这件事的文章来变得非常熟练。回到商学院的案例研究，这是一个经典的例子。

他们研究别人的生意，但实际上，通过经营自己的柠檬水摊或类似的东西，你会学到更多关于经营生意的知识。甚至在街上开一家小零售店也比MBA好。

这就是你在工作中学习的方式，因为很多细微之处在你真正进入工作之前是无法表现出来的。

例如，现在每个人都喜欢心理模型。你去法南街，去查利的年鉴，你可以学到所有不同的心智模式。但是哪个更重要呢?你更常应用哪些?哪些在什么情况下重要?这才是最难的部分。

例如，我个人的经验是，委托代理问题在这个世界上起着很大的推动作用。这是一个激励问题。我明白了以牙还牙的囚徒困境是博弈论中最有价值的部分。你几乎可以把博弈论的书放下。

顺便说一下，学习博弈论最好的方法就是多玩游戏。我从来没读过博弈论的书。我认为自己非常擅长博弈论。我从来没有翻开博弈论的书，发现一个结果，我没有想过，“哦，是的，这对我来说是常识。”

原因是我从小玩各种各样的游戏，和各种各样的朋友遇到各种各样的困境，所以这对我来说是第二天性。你总能在工作中学习得更好。
## 迭代，数量驱动学习曲线

但是做是一件微妙的事情。do封装了很多东西。例如，我想学习如何经营一家企业。好吧,如果我创业,我每天都在和我做同样的事情,比方说我开了一个零售商店，在街上,在管理我商店的货架上的食品和酒的每一天,虽然我不打算学那么多,但我重复的事情很多。

所以，我投入了成千上万个小时，在做同样的事情。然而，如果我进行数千次迭代，那就不一样了。因此，学习曲线是跨迭代的(而不是迭代)。

如果我是在店里尝试新的营销实验,不断变化的库存,不断变化的品牌和消息传递,我不断变化, 改变在线渠道,我尝试在不同的时间开放,和店主交谈。

驱动学习曲线的是迭代次数。所以，你可以有更多的迭代，你可以有更多的射门，你将更快地学习。这不仅仅是时间的问题。

## **如果你愿意每天都流点血，以后你可能会大获全胜**

它实际上是两者的结合，但我认为仅仅是我们的构建方式和世界呈现自己的方式，世界很容易为我们提供机会，让我们一遍又一遍地做同样的事情。但说真的，如果我们能走出去，从头开始寻找新的方法，我们会得到更好的服务。

第一次尝试新事物是痛苦的，因为你正徘徊在一个不确定的领域，你很有可能会失败。所以你必须对经常发生的小失败感到非常、非常舒服。

纳西姆·塔勒布也谈到了这一点。他基本上依靠黑天鹅发了财。纳西姆·塔勒布靠每天损失一点钱来赚钱，而当别人无法想象的事情发生在他身上时，他却能赚很多钱。

虽然大多数人每天都想赚点小钱，但作为交换，他们会容忍大量的破产风险，他们会容忍彻底破产。

我们没有进化到每天流血一点点。如果你在自然环境中，你被割伤了，你每天都会流血，你最终会死。你得把伤口止住。

我们一直在为小的胜利而进化，但那将变得非常昂贵。那是人群聚集的地方。那就是兽群所在的地方。所以，如果你愿意每天都流点血，作为交换，你以后会赢很多，你会做得更好。

顺便说一下，这就是企业家精神。企业家每天都在流血。

他们不是在赚钱，他们是在赔钱，他们不断地承受压力，所有的责任都在他们身上，但当他们赢了，他们就赢得很大。平均而言，他们会赚得更多。
# **19. 承担责任来获得影响力**

接受问责。社会会用杠杆来奖励你。

## **你必须依靠问责制来获得影响力**

尼维:我们来谈谈问责制吧，我觉得这很有趣，你对这个问题有自己独特的看法。所以第一条关于问责的推文是，“拥抱问责，以自己的名义承担商业风险。”社会会用责任、公平和影响力来回报你。”

纳瓦尔:是的。所以要想变得富有，你需要杠杆。杠杆来自劳动力，资本，也可以通过代码或媒体。但是其中大部分，像劳动力和资本，人们必须给你。为了劳动力，总得有人跟着你。为了资本，必须有人给你钱或资产来管理或机器。

因此，为了得到这些东西，你必须建立信誉，你必须以自己的名义尽可能多地做这些事情，这是有风险的。因此，问责制是一件双刃剑。当事情进展顺利时，你可以把功劳归于自己;当事情进展不顺时，你承受失败带来的冲击。

## **以自己的名义承担商业风险**

所以从这个意义上说，把自己的名字印在东西上的人并不愚蠢。他们只是自信。也许这最终会被证明是愚蠢的，但如果你看看坎耶(Kanye)、奥普拉(Oprah)、特朗普(Trump)、伊隆(Elon)或任何类似的人，这些人可以凭借自己的名字致富，因为他们的名字具有强大的品牌效应。

不管你怎么看特朗普，你都必须意识到，这个家伙在打造自己的品牌方面是世界上最好的。你为什么要去特朗普赌场?因为特朗普。你为什么要去特朗普大厦?因为特朗普。

到了投票的时候，我想很多选民只是走进来说，“特朗普。他们认出了这个名字，所以这个名字得到了回报。

奥普拉也是如此。她把自己的品牌放在某样东西上，她的名字放在某样东西上，然后它就从货架上飞了下来，就像一个即时验证器。

这些人也冒着把自己的名字公布在网上的风险。很明显，特朗普现在可能被一半或超过一半的美国人，以及世界上大部分人所憎恨，因为他坚持自己的名字。

把你的名字公布出来，你就成了名人，而名声有很多很多的缺点。默默无闻而富有总比贫穷而出名好，但即便是出名而富有也有很多负面影响。你总是在公众的视线里。

## **一个运作良好的团队对每个职位都有明确的责任**

问责制是非常重要的，当你在开发一个产品，或者你在一个团队中工作，或者你在一个企业中工作时，我们不断地在脑海中反复灌输成为团队成员的重要性。完全同意。

我们的很多社交训练告诉我们不要把脖子伸出人群。我从澳大利亚朋友那里听说，高大的罂粟花被剪掉了。不要冒风险，但我想说的是，一个真正、真正运转良好的团队规模很小，对每个不同的部分都有明确的责任。

你可以说，“好的，这个人负责开发产品。这个人负责信息传递。这个人负责筹集资金。这个人负责定价策略，也许还负责在线广告。“所以如果有人搞砸了，你就知道谁该负责。与此同时，如果事情进展得很顺利，你也知道谁该对此负责。

如果你有一个小团队，并且你有明确的职责，那么你仍然可以保持非常高的责任感。问责制真的很重要，因为当一件事成功或失败时，如果它失败了，每个人都会互相指责，如果它成功了，每个人都会站出来邀功。

我们都有过这样的经历，当我们在学校的时候，我们有一个小组作业要做。里面可能有几个人做了很多工作。还有一些人只是做了很多哗众取宠的事情。我们从童年时代就对这个很熟悉，但是谈论这个有点不舒服。

## **在公共场合失败的人有很大的权力**

明确的问责制很重要。没有问责制，就没有激励机制。没有问责制，你就无法建立信誉。但你要承担风险。你承担失败的风险。你冒着丢脸的风险。你以自己的名义承担失败的风险。

幸运的是，在现代社会，没有更多的债务人监狱，人们不会因为输了别人的钱而入狱或被处死，但我们在社会上仍然害怕以自己的名义在公共场合失败。那些有能力以自己的名义在公共场合失败的人实际上获得了很多权力。

例如，我要讲一个个人轶事。直到2013年和2014年，我的公众形象完全围绕着创业和投资。直到2014年，2015年我才开始谈论哲学和心理学以及更广泛的东西。

这让我有点紧张，因为我是以自己的名义做的。在这个行业里肯定有人通过幕后渠道给我发信息，比如，“你在做什么?”你要结束你的职业生涯了。这是愚蠢的。”

我只是随波逐流。我冒险了。和数字货币一样。早些时候，我冒了个险。

但是当你把你的名字写出来的时候，你就在某些事情上冒险了。你也会得到回报。你得到了好处。

# **20.承担责任来获得公平**

如果你有很高的责任感，你就不会那么容易被取代，你也可以从生意中分一杯羹。

## **问责制是你获得公平的方式**

纳瓦尔:问责制很重要，因为这是你获得影响力的方式。这就是你获得信誉的方式。这也是你获得公平权益的方式。你会从中分得一杯羹。

当你和别人谈判时，最终如果别人决定如何补偿你，这个决定将基于你的可替代性。如果你有很强的责任感，那么你就不会那么容易被取代。然后他们必须给你股权，这是好处的一部分。

## **承担责任帮你在所有的工作中获得公平**

股权本身就是一个很好的例子，因为股权也是一种基于风险的工具。衡平法是指在所有需要担保资金的人都得到偿还之后，你得到了所有的回报。

如果你看一个公司的资本等级，员工首先得到报酬。他们先领工资。在法律[破产]程序中，工资是神圣不可侵犯的。如果你是一名董事会成员，而公司花了太多钱，又有欠薪要付，政府可以亲自追着你还工资。员工获得了最大的安全感，但作为这种安全感的交换，他们没有那么多的优势。

下一个是债券持有者，他们可能是借钱给公司运营的银行家，他们需要每月或每年支付固定息票，但除此之外，他们没有更多的收益。他们可能一年赚5 10 15 20 25，但这就是他们的优势所在。

最后是股东。这些人实际上将获得大部分好处。一旦债务持有人得到偿还，工资得到支付，剩下的钱就归他们所有。

但是如果没有足够的钱来支付工资和债务持有人，或者仅仅是刚好有足够的钱来支付工资和债务持有人，这是大多数企业的情况，大多数时候，股权持有人什么都得不到。

股权持有者承担了更大的风险，但作为交换，他们几乎可以获得无限的收益。你可以对你所有的工作做同样的事情。从本质上讲，对自己的行为负责与在所有工作中采取公平的立场是一样的。你是在冒更大的下行风险换取更大的上行。

要知道，在现代社会，下行风险并没有那么大。在良好的生态系统中，即使个人破产也能将债务一笔勾销。我最熟悉硅谷，一般来说，人们会原谅失败，只要你是诚实的，并付出了很高的正直努力。

对于失败其实没什么好害怕的，所以人们应该承担更多的责任。

尼维:问责制真的很脆弱吗?还是说我们天生就不会在公共场合失败，所以感觉很脆弱?

纳瓦尔:我认为它实际上可能很脆弱。问责制的一个例子是你是一名飞行员。作为机长，你要对整个飞机负责。

假设飞机出了问题。你以后不能把责任推到别人身上。你不能怪乘务员或女乘务员。你不能怪副驾驶。你是队长。你要对这艘船负责。如果你搞砸了，你就撞毁了这艘船，会有直接的后果。

在过去，人们希望船长和船一起沉没。如果船在下沉，那么字面上来说，最后一个下船的人就是船长。我认为问责制确实伴随着真正的风险，但我们谈论的是商业环境。

这里的风险是，你可能是最后一个拿回资本的人。你会是最后一个得到报酬的人。你投入的时间，投入的资金，这些都是有风险的。

即使一家公司倒闭了，而你的名字就在上面，这也不像诚信问题那么糟糕。比如伯尼·麦道夫，麦道夫投资公司，这个名字在投资界就不会再好了。你可能是伯尼·麦道夫的曾曾曾孙。你不会去做投资生意，因为他毁了家族的名声。

我认为，如今，一个名字所带来的责任风险更多地是围绕诚信，而不是纯粹的经济失败。

## **在这场游戏中，问责制是声誉的外衣**

尼维:对我来说，问责制的最大好处是，你的问责制会直接得到相应的回报。我还认为，这也是为什么像塔勒布这样的人会抱怨那些没有责任感就能获得奖励的ceo。

纳瓦尔:是的。塔勒布的skin in the game值得阅读。如果你想在现代生活中有所成就并了解现代系统是如何工作的，那么《Skin in The Game》将是我的首选读物。

问责制，Skin in The Game，这些概念是紧密联系在一起的。我认为责任是Skin in The Game。这是在拿你的个人声誉冒险，因为你是游戏中的一员。

问责制是一个简单的概念。问责制唯一有点违反直觉的地方是，我们目前在社会上被洗脑，不愿承担责任，不是以一种可见的方式。

我认为有一些方法可以让团队中的每一个成员都承担起自己的责任。这就是你如何让一个运作良好的团队，同时仍然把信用和损失放在正确的栏目。


# **21. 劳动力和资本是老的杠杆**

获得财富需要利用**杠杆**。劳动力和资本是更古老的杠杆形式，每个人都在为之奋斗。

## **我们的大脑还没有进化到能够理解新的杠杆形式**

尼维:我们来谈谈杠杆吧?

风暴中的第一条推特是阿基米德的一句名言，“给我一个足够长的杠杆和一个可以站立的地方，我就能移动地球。”

下一条推特是“财富需要杠杆”。商业杠杆来自资本、人员和产品，没有复制的边际成本。”

纳瓦尔:影响力至关重要。我把阿基米德的名言放在这里的原因是…通常我不喜欢把别人的名言放在我的推特上。这没有任何价值。你可以自己去查查那些人的名言。但是我必须在这里引用这句话，因为它太基础了。我很小很小的时候读过这本书，它给我留下了深刻的印象。

当我们使用跷跷板或杠杆时，我们都知道杠杆是什么。我们知道这在生理上是如何运作的，但我认为我们的大脑并没有真正进化到能够理解现代社会中杠杆有多大的可能性，以及最新的杠杆形式是什么。

## **社会高估了劳动力的杠杆作用**

最古老的杠杆形式是劳动力，也就是为你工作的人。不用我搬石头，我可以让10个人搬石头。然后，仅仅是根据我的指导，岩石应该去哪里，更多的岩石被移动，比我自己能做的多的多。每个人都明白这一点，因为我们进化到理解杠杆的劳动形式，所以社会高估了劳动力作为杠杆形式的价值。

这就是为什么当你升职时，你的父母对你印象深刻，因为你有很多下属。这就是为什么当很多天真的人，当你告诉他们你的公司时，他们会说，“有多少人在那里工作?”“他们将以此作为建立信誉的一种方式。他们试图衡量你到底有多大的影响力。

或者当有人发起一场运动时，他们会说他们有多少人或者军队有多大。我们只是自然而然地认为人越多越好。

## **你想要最低限度的劳动力，使你可以使用其他形式的杠杆**

我认为这是你可能使用的最糟糕的杠杆形式。管理他人是非常麻烦的。它需要高超的领导技巧。你离兵变、被暴民吃掉或撕成碎片只有一步之遥。

竞争异常激烈。整个文明都被这场战争摧毁了。例如，共产主义、马克思主义，都是关于资本与劳动、资本论与劳动之间的斗争。这有点像陷阱。

你真的想远离以劳动力为基础的杠杆。你希望和你一起工作的人最少，或者能允许你使用其他形式的杠杆，我认为这更有趣。

## **资本在上个世纪一直是杠杆的主要形式**

第二种杠杆是资本。这一点对我们的影响没那么大。因为大量的钱在流动，被存起来，投入到货币市场中，这些都是人类在过去几百到几千年里的发明。它们不是和我们一起进化而来的。

我们对它们的理解不是很好。正确使用它们可能需要更多的智能，而我们使用它们的方式也在不断变化。一百年前的管理技能可能仍然适用于今天，但投资一百年前的股市技能可能不适用于今天。

资本是一种使用起来更为棘手的杠杆形式。更现代。在过去的一个世纪里，它被人们用来获得惊人的财富，可能是上个世纪最主要的杠杆形式。

你可以从谁是最富有的人看出这一点。是银行家，腐败国家的政客们印钞票，本质上是那些把大量的钱转移的人。

如果你看看大公司的高层，除了科技公司，在很多很多老公司，首席执行官的工作实际上是财务工作。他们是真正的金融资产管理者。有时，资产经理可以摆出一副愉快的面孔，所以你就会得到一个沃伦•巴菲特(Warren Buffet)式的人物。

但在内心深处，我认为我们都不喜欢资本作为杠杆的一种形式，因为它让人感觉不公平。它是一种无形的东西，可以积累并代代相传，突然间似乎导致人们拥有巨额财富，而身边没有其他人，也不一定能分享。

也就是说，资本是一种强大的杠杆形式。它可以转化为劳动力。它可以转换成其他东西。

如果你是一个聪明的投资者，投资10亿美元，你可以用它获得30%的回报，而其他人只能获得20%的回报，你将得到所有的钱，你将因此得到丰厚的回报。

它的伸缩性非常非常好。如果你善于管理资本，你能比管理越来越多的人更容易管理越来越多的资本。

## **你需要特殊知识和责任感来获得资金**

这是一种很好的杠杆形式，但资本的难点在于你如何获得它?这就是为什么我首先谈到特殊知识和责任。

如果你在一个领域有特殊知识，如果你有责任感，并且你在那个领域有一个好名声，那么人们就会给你资金作为杠杆的一种形式，你可以用它来获得更多的资金。

如果你在一个领域有特殊知识，如果你有责任感，并且你在那个领域有一个好名声，那么人们就会给你资金作为杠杆的一种形式，你可以用它来获得更多的资金。

资本也相当容易理解。我认为，很多对资本主义的抨击都是因为资本的积累。


# **22. 产品和媒体是新的杠杆**

产品和媒体是新财富的杠杆。在你睡觉的时候为你创建软件和媒体。

## **产品和媒体是新的杠杆**

纳瓦尔:最有趣和最重要的杠杆形式是这种没有边际复制成本的产品。这是一种新的杠杆形式。

这是最近几百年才发明的。它始于印刷机。它随着广播媒体的发展而加速发展，现在随着互联网和编码技术的发展而迅猛发展。

现在，你可以在不需要其他人参与，也不需要别人出钱的情况下，加倍努力。

这个播客是一种杠杆。很久以前，我必须坐在教室里，亲自给你们每个人讲课。我可能会接触到几百人，也就是这么多。

40年前，30年前，如果我能上电视，我一定很幸运，这是别人的优势。他们会歪曲信息。他们会把经济学从里面拿出来，或者向我收费。他们会把信息搞混，而我如果能得到这种形式的杠杆，那就太幸运了。

今天，多亏了互联网，我可以买一个便宜的麦克风，把它连接到笔记本电脑或iPad上，你们都在听。

## **产品杠杆是创造新财富的地方**

这种最新的杠杆形式创造了所有的新财富，所有的新亿万富翁。上一代人靠资本创造财富。那就是全世界的沃伦自助餐。

但新一代的财富都是通过代码或媒体创造的。乔·罗根(Joe Rogan)通过播客每年赚5000万到1亿美元。你会有一个PewDiePie。我不知道他赚了多少钱，但他比新闻还重要。Fortnite球员。当然还有杰夫·贝佐斯、马克·扎克伯格、拉里·佩奇、谢尔盖·布林、比尔·盖茨和史蒂夫·乔布斯。这都是基于代码的杠杆。

## **将这三种形式的杠杆结合起来是一种神奇的组合**

现在，当你把这三个结合起来的时候，美就出现了。这就是科技初创公司真正擅长的地方，在这里你只需要你能得到的最低限度，但最高产出的劳动力，也就是工程师、设计师和产品开发人员。然后加上资本。你可以用它来做营销，广告，扩大规模。你添加了大量的代码、媒体、播客和内容，把所有的东西都放在那里。

这是一个神奇的组合，这就是为什么你会看到科技初创公司突然冒出来，利用巨大的杠杆，获得巨大的超额回报。

## **产品和媒体杠杆是不需要允许的**

尼维:你想谈谈允许与不允许的区别吗?

纳瓦尔:关于新的杠杆形式，最值得注意的可能是它们是不需要允许使用的。他们不需要别人的允许你使用他们或成功。

对于劳动力杠杆，必须有人决定追随你。对于资本杠杆，必须有人给你钱来投资或者变成产品。

编码、写书、录制播客、推特、youtube，这些都是不允许的。你不需要任何人的许可，这就是为什么他们是非常平等的。它们是杠杆的很好的均衡器。

尽管人们可能会在Facebook和YouTube上抱怨，但他们不会停止使用它，因为这种没有许可的杠杆作用太好了。在这种杠杆作用下，每个人都可以成为一名播音员。

同样，你也可以指责苹果在iPhone上有一个略微封闭的生态系统，但每个人都在为它编写应用程序。只要你可以为它编写应用程序，你就可以通过这样做致富或接触到用户，为什么不呢?

## **机器人军队已经在这里了——代码等你告诉他们该做什么**

我想到了所有的杠杆形式，现代社会中最好的一种，这就是油嘴滑舌。这有点过度使用了。这就是为什么我告诉人们学习编程。我们有这样的想法，未来会有这些机器人，它们会做所有的事情。

这也许是真的，但我要说的是，机器人革命的大部分已经发生了。机器人已经出现了，而且机器人的数量远远超过人类，只是我们出于热量和效率的原因把它们塞进了数据中心。我们把它们放在服务器上。它们在电脑里。所有的电路，都是里面的机器人大脑在做所有的工作。

例如，每一个伟大的软件开发人员，现在都有一群机器人在晚上为他工作，当他或她睡觉的时候，在他们写完代码之后，它就开始工作了。

机器人大军已经来了。机器人革命已经发生了。我们已经完成一半了。随着我们对自动驾驶汽车、自动飞机、自动船只，也许还有自动卡车的概念越来越熟悉，我们现在正在添加更多的硬件组件。有送货机器人，波士顿动力公司的机器人等等。

但是，例如，为你进行网络搜索的机器人已经在这里了。那些清理你的视频和音频并将其传播到世界各地的人已经在这里了。那些回答许多客户服务问题的人，那些你不得不打电话给人的人已经在这里了。

一队机器人已经在这里了。非常便宜。瓶颈在于找出对它们做的聪明而有趣的事情。

基本上你可以命令这支机器人大军。命令必须用计算机语言发出，用他们能理解的语言。

这些机器人不是很聪明。必须非常精确地告诉他们该做什么以及如何做。编码是如此强大的超能力，因为现在你可以讲机器人军队的语言，你可以告诉他们该做什么。

尼维:我认为在这一点上，人们不仅通过代码指挥服务器内的机器人大军，他们实际上还在操纵卡车和其他人的移动。只要在亚马逊上订购一个包裹，你就可以操纵许多人和许多机器人的移动，让包裹送到你手中。

人们现在也在做同样的事情来建立企业。服务器中有机器人大军，也有真正的机器人大军，还有通过软件操纵的人。



# **23. 产品杠杆是平等的**

劳动力和资本被限制在控制这些资源的人手中。但产品却进入了全球市场。

## **产品杠杆是一个正和博弈**

纳瓦尔:劳动力和资本不那么平等，不仅在投入上，而且在产出上。

比方说，我需要一些人类必须提供的东西，比如我想要按摩，或者我需要有人为我做饭。提供这种服务的人性化因素越多，平等主义就越少。杰夫·贝佐斯(Jeff Bezos)的假期可能比我们大多数人都要好过，因为他身边有很多人在忙着做他需要做的事情。

如果你看看代码和媒体的输出，杰夫·贝佐斯(Jeff Bezos)没有比我们更好的电影和电视了。杰夫·贝佐斯甚至没有更好的计算机体验。谷歌没有给他提供一些高级的，特殊的谷歌帐户，他的搜索更好。

代码和媒体输出的本质是每个人都可以访问相同的产品。这就变成了一个正和博弈如果杰夫·贝佐斯和其他一千个人消费同样的产品，那么这个产品就会比杰夫自己消费的产品更好。

## **身份商品仅限于少数人**

而对于其他产品，就不是这样了。如果你考虑买一块劳力士手表，它不再是用来计时的。这是一个很好的信号。这都是为了炫耀，“我有一块劳力士表。“这是一个零和游戏。

如果世界上的每个人都戴着劳力士，那么人们就不会再戴劳力士了，因为他们不再发出信号了。它抵消了效果。

富人在消费这种产品方面确实有优势。他们只会把价格抬高，直到只有他们能买到劳力士为止。那么穷人就不能拥有劳力士和劳力士恢复他们的信号价值。

## **最好的产品往往是针对中产阶级的**

比如看Netflix，谷歌，Facebook, YouTube，甚至是现代汽车。富人没有更好的车。他们只是有更奇怪的车。

你不能在街上以任何对兰博基尼有意义的速度驾驶兰博基尼，所以在街上开兰博基尼实际上是一辆更糟糕的车。在那个时候它变成了一个很好的信号。你的最佳位置，你想去的地方，是像特斯拉Model 3或丰田花冠是一辆了不起的车。

一辆新的丰田花冠确实是一辆好车，但因为它是主流，这项技术已经将生产成本分摊到尽可能多的消费者身上。

最好的产品往往在中间，在最佳位置，中产阶级，而不是针对上层阶级。

## **用产品创造财富会带来更多的合乎道德的财富**

我想的一件事,我们在现代社会不一定欣赏杠杆的形式已经从人性化、替代和物变成更多的产品和代码和媒体,大多数我们消费的商品和服务的消费越来越平等。

甚至食物也在变成这样。至少在第一世界，食物变得越来越便宜和丰富，这对我们的危害太大了。杰夫·贝佐斯并不一定吃得更好。他只是吃了不同的食物，或者他吃的食物是精心准备的，而且是很有特色的，所以这更像是表演中的人性因素。

但是食品生产中的劳动力成分已经大幅下降。资本要素大幅下降。甚至粮食生产本身也变得更加以技术为导向，因此贫富之间的差距正在缩小。

如果你关心财富创造中的道德规范，那么最好是使用代码和媒体作为杠杆来创造财富，因为那样的话，这些产品对所有人都是平等的，而不是试图通过劳动或资本来创造财富。

## **你想使用大多数人都使用的产品**

这里我指的是规模经济。科技产品和媒体产品具有惊人的规模经济，你总是想要使用被大多数人使用的产品。被大多数人使用的那个最终拥有最大的预算。添加另一个用户没有边际成本，所以预算越大，质量越好。

实际上，最好的电视节目不会是那些只为少数富人制作的默默无闻的节目。他们将会是大预算的，比如《权力的游戏》、《绝命毒师》或《鸟盒子》，他们有非常非常高的预算。他们可以用这些预算达到一定的质量水平。

然后富人，为了与众不同，他们必须坐飞机去圣丹斯看纪录片。你和我不会飞到圣丹斯去，因为那是无聊的富人炫耀的方式。我们不会去看纪录片，因为他们中的大多数人实际上都没有那么好。

再说一次，如果你今天很富有，对于很多东西，你把钱花在向别人展示你很富有的商品上，然后你试着把它们转化为地位。而不是为了商品本身而消费。

尼维:人力和资本作为杠杆的一种形式具有负外部性，代码和产品具有正外部性，如果我要总结你的观点的话。

## **资本和劳动力杠杆越来越不受欢迎**

我认为，资本和劳动力也开始变得越来越少，或者说，至少由于互联网的存在，许可变得越来越分散。而不是劳动，我们现在有了社区，这是一种分散的劳动形式。例如，马克·扎克伯格有10亿人通过Facebook为他工作。

现在我们有了众筹，而不是从富人那里筹集资金。你可以为慈善机构、健康问题或企业筹集数百万美元。你可以在网上完成。

资本和劳动力也变得不受许可，你不需要用老式的方式，你必须四处征求人们的许可来使用他们的金钱或时间。



# **24. 选择一个有杠杠的商业模式**

理想情况下，您应该选择具有网络效应、低边际成本和规模经济的商业模式。

## **规模经济:生产越多，成本越低**

尼维:还有一个关于杠杆的问题。你认为商业模式的选择或产品的选择也能带来某种杠杆作用吗?

例如，从事具有网络效应的业务。追求具有品牌效应的业务。或者是人们可以操纵的其他商业模式的选择，这就给了你自由的杠杆。

纳瓦尔:对，有一些非常好的微观经济概念是需要理解的。

其中之一就是规模经济，你生产的东西越多，生产出来的东西就越便宜。很多企业都有基础经济学101。

你应该试着进入这样一个行业，让No12号小部件比No5号小部件便宜，让No10000号小部件比之前的小部件便宜得多。这就建立了一个自动的进入壁垒，以对抗竞争。这一点很重要。

## **零边际再生产成本:生产更多是免费的**

另一个是，沿着同样的路线，对科技产品，尤其是媒体产品，有很高质量，但是它们的边际复制成本为零。创建您刚刚创建的另一个副本是免费的。

当有人听这个播客或看YouTube上关于这个的视频时，我不会为下一个出现的人付出任何代价。那些零边际成本的东西，他们需要一段时间才能开始。你每个用户赚的钱很少，但是随着时间的推移，它们真的会累积起来。

乔·罗根在他现在的播客上工作并不比他在播客1上更努力，但是在播客1100上，他从播客上赚了100万美元，而在之前的第一个播客上，他可能亏了钱。这就是边际成本为零的例子。

## **网络效应:价值随着客户数量的增加而增长**

然后，最微妙但最重要的是网络效应的概念。它来自计算机网络。以太网的发明者鲍勃·梅特卡夫(Bob Metcalfe)提出了著名的梅特卡夫定律，即网络的价值与网络中节点数量的平方成正比。

如果大小为10的网络的值为100，那么大小为100的网络的值为10,000。不是10倍，而是100倍，因为是正方形;差值是平方。

如果你是网络效应行业的老大，你就赢得了一切。如果你看看Facebook，你的朋友和家人的社交网络协议。他们的竞争对手是谁? 没有人，因为他们通过网络效应赢得了一切。这就是为什么当人们说，“好吧，我可以离开Facebook”时，他们没有意识到网络效应创造了自然垄断。它们是非常非常强大的东西。

## **网络效应企业是自然垄断企业**

硅谷的一个肮脏秘密是，许多成功的企业都是自然垄断企业。甚至拼车也是倾向于赢家通吃的系统。

优步的经济效益将永远好于Lyft，只要它能调动更多的司机和乘客。像谷歌，基本上只有一个可行的搜索引擎。我确实喜欢DuckDuckGo，隐私方面的原因，但是他们总是因为网络的影响而落后。Twitter:你还会去哪里找微博呢?甚至YouTube的网络效应也很弱，但它们仍然足够强大，没有第二个网站可以让你经常去看视频。事实证明，甚至在电子长尾、亚马逊Prime以及存储信用卡和信息的便利性中，创造了强大的网络效应。

## **在网络效应中，每个新用户都为现有用户增加了价值**

什么是网络效应?让我们精确地定义一下。网络效应是指每个额外的用户都为现有的用户群增加了价值。您的用户本身正在为现有用户创建一些价值。

我认为大家都能理解的一个经典例子是语言。假设社区里有100个人，他们说10种不同的语言，每个人只说这10种语言中的一种。你必须一直翻译;这是非常痛苦的。但如果你们100个人都说同一种语言，它将会带来巨大的价值。

社区的运作方式是，10个人开始说10种语言，假设有一个额外的人学习英语。现在突然有11个人懂英语了，所以下一个来学新语言的人很可能会选择英语。在某一时刻，假设英语人数达到20或25人，就完成了。它将拥有整个语言市场，其他语言将被淘汰。

这就是为什么，从长远来看，整个世界可能最终会说英语和汉语。中国的互联网是封闭的，但互联网本身是一个很好的平台，想在互联网上交流的人被迫说英语，因为互联网上最大的群体“说英语”。

我总是为我那些在国外说外语长大的同事们感到难过，因为你没有那么多书可读;这么多书还没有被翻译成其他语言。例如，如果你只会说法语，或者只会说德语，或者只会说印地语，你在技术教育中就会处于严重的劣势。

毫无疑问，如果你去接受技术教育，你就必须学习英语，因为你必须读那些没有翻译过数据的书。语言可能是网络效应最古老的例子。

金钱是另一个例子。我们可能都应该使用同样的钱，除了一个事实，即地理和监管界限创造了这些人为的金钱孤岛。但即便如此，世界在大多数时候仍倾向于使用单一货币作为储备货币;目前，美元。

## **零边际成本业务可以转向网络效应业务**

网络效应是一个非常强大的概念，当你选择一个商业模式时，选择一个可以从网络效应、低边际成本和规模经济中获益的模式是一个非常好的主意;而这些倾向于同时发生。

任何边际生产成本为零的东西显然都具有规模经济，而边际生产成本为零的东西往往具有网络效应，因为推广它不需要更多成本。这样你就可以为用户创建小钩子来互相增加价值。

你应该始终考虑你的用户，你的客户，如何能够互相增加价值，因为这是杠杆的最终形式。你在巴哈马群岛的海滩上，或者你晚上睡觉，而你的客户在互相增值。

# **25. 一个例子：从劳动者到企业家**

从劳动者到房地产科技公司，从低到高的专业知识、问责制和杠杆作用是一个连续的过程。

## **劳动者按小时计酬，责任意识较低**

纳瓦尔:tweetstorm非常抽象。它的本意是要广泛适用于各种不同的领域和学科，时间和地点。但是有时候，没有具体的例子是很难理解的。让我们具体谈一下。

看看房地产行业。你可以从最底层开始，假设你是一个日工。你进来，修理人们的房子。有人命令你，告诉你，“打碎那块石头。”把那块木头磨成沙。把那个东西放在那边。”

在建筑工地上，到处都是卑微的工作。如果你从事其中一项工作，除非你是熟练的行业人士，比如木匠或电工，否则你真的没有特殊知识。

即使是木匠或电工也没有那么特殊，因为其他人可以训练如何做。你可以被取代。你的工资是15美元，20美元，25美元，50美元，如果你很幸运的话，每小时75美元，但仅此而已。

除了你所使用的工具之外，你没有任何优势。如果你开的是推土机，那比用手推要好。在印度，一个日工挣得少得多，因为他们没有工具杠杆。

你没有太多的责任感。你只是建筑工队里一个无名小卒，房子的主人或买主根本不知道或不关心你的工作。

## **总承包商获得了股权，但他们也在承担风险**

再往上一步，你可能会有一个承包商，就像一个总承包商，有人雇他来修房子。总承包商承担责任;他们承担责任。

假设他们得到了25万美元的报酬。抱歉，我用的是旧金山湾区的价格，也许我可以用世界其他地方的价格，10万美元来装修一所房子，而实际上，总承包商总共花了7万美元。承包商会得到剩下的3万美元。

他们得到了好处。他们获得了股权，但也承担了责任和风险。如果项目超时，出现了亏损，他们就会接受亏损。但你看，仅仅是问责制就给了他们某种形式的额外潜在收入。

然后，他们还有劳动力杠杆。因为他们有一群人为他们工作。但它可能在这里达到顶点。

## **房地产开发商通过运用资本杠杆来获取利润**

你可以再往上一层看看房地产开发商。这可能是一个承包商，他做了很多房子，做得很好，然后决定自己创业，他们四处寻找有潜力的二手房。

他们买下这些房子，要么从投资者那里筹集资金，要么自己预付，他们把房子修缮好，然后以两倍于买价的价格卖掉。也许他们只多投入了20%，这是一个不错的利润。

所以现在像这样的开发者承担了更多的责任，承担了更多的风险。他们有更特殊知识，因为现在你必须知道:哪些社区值得购买。哪些是好的，哪些是坏的。需要构成或破坏特定属性的东西。你必须想象完工的房子会在那里，即使现在的房产看起来很糟糕。

有了更特殊知识，有了更多的责任和风险，现在你也有了资本杠杆，因为你也把钱投入到项目中。但可以想象的是，你可以花20万美元买一块地或一栋破旧的房子，然后把它变成一栋价值100万美元的豪宅，剩下的全部收入囊中。

## **架构师、大型开发人员和reit的等级甚至更高**

除此之外的一个层次可能是著名的建筑师或开发人员，因为您已经完成了许多出色的工作，所以只要在工作上有您的名字，就可以增加它的价值。

再往上一层，你可能会决定，我懂房地产，现在我对房地产的动态有了足够的了解，我要成为一个大开发商，而不仅仅是建造和翻转我自己的房产或改善我自己的房产。我要建立整个社区。

另一个人可能会说，“我喜欢这种杠杆，但我不想管理所有这些人。我想通过资本做得更多。所以我要成立一个房地产投资信托。“这不仅需要对房地产投资和建设有具体的了解，还需要对金融市场、资本市场以及房地产信托如何运作有具体的了解。

## **房地产科技公司运用了最大的杠杆**

一个更高层次的人可能会说，“实际上，我想在这个市场上发挥最大的杠杆作用，以及最大限度的特殊知识。那个人会说，“嗯，我了解房地产，我了解一切，从基本的房屋建设，到建造和销售房产，到房地产市场如何运行和繁荣，我也了解科技行业。”我知道如何招募开发人员，如何编写代码，如何打造好产品，我知道如何从风险投资家那里筹集资金，如何回报，以及所有这些是如何运作的。”

显然没有一个人知道这一点。您可以将一个团队拉到一起，每个团队都有不同的技能集，但是合并后的实体将具有特定的技术和房地产知识。

它将有巨大的责任，公司的名字将是一个非常高的风险，高回报的努力附加到整个事情，人们会把他们的生命投入到它，承担重大的风险。

它将对许多开发人员的代码产生影响。它将拥有投资者投入的资本和创始人自己的资本。它将拥有一些你能找到的最高质量的劳动力，即为公司工作的高质量工程师、设计师和营销人员。

然后你可能会拥有一家Trulia或RedFin或Zillow这样的公司，然后潜在的好处可能是数十亿美元，或数亿美元。

越来越多的知识只能在工作中获得叠加,不是常识,越来越多的责任和风险叠加,而且你的工作在叠加越来越多的伟大的人,越来越多的资本,和越来越多的代码和媒体。天空才是极限。



# **26. 判断力是决定性的技能**

到目前为止我们所讨论的一切都是为了让你做出判断。

## **在一个杠杆率无限的时代，判断成为最重要的技能**

尼维:我们谈了特殊知识，谈了问责制，谈了杠杆。纳瓦尔在推特风暴中谈到的最后一个技能是判断，他说，“杠杆是你判断的力量倍增器。”

纳瓦尔:我们现在生活在一个杠杆几乎无限的时代，所有的巨大财富都是通过杠杆创造的。你的第一项工作是获得杠杆，你可以通过让别人为你工作或筹集资金来获得杠杆。

或者你可以通过学习如何编码，或者成为一个好的沟通者，播客，广播，视频制作，写作等等，不经许可地获得优势。

这就是你获得杠杆的方式，但一旦你有了杠杆，你会怎么做?好吧，你事业的第一部分是为了获得优势。一旦你有了筹码，你就想慢下来，因为你的判断真的很重要。

就像你从驾驶帆船转到现在驾驶远洋班轮或油轮一样。你有更多的风险，但你也有更多的收获。你的有效载荷要高得多。在一个杠杆率无限的时代，判断成为最重要的技能。

沃伦•巴菲特(Warren Buffett)现在之所以如此富有，是因为他的判断力。即使你拿走沃伦所有的钱，明天，投资者就会突然出现，给他1000亿美元，因为他们知道他的判断力很好，他们会给他1000亿美元中的很大一部分用于投资。

## **你所做的其他一切都是在帮你做出判断**

最终，你所做的其他一切实际上都是在帮助你应用你的判断。人们抱怨的一件大事就是CEO的薪酬。当然有裙带资本主义，这些ceo控制着他们的董事会，董事会给了他们太多的钱。

但是，也有一些ceo因为他们的判断力更好而获得了这份工作。如果你驾驶的是一艘大船，如果你驾驶的是谷歌或苹果，而你的判断力比其他人强10%或20%，那么社会就会付给你数亿美元，因为你驾驶的是一艘价值1000亿美元的大船。

如果你比其他人多10%或20%的时间在有效工作上，那么你管理的数千亿美元的复合收益将会非常大，与之相比，你的CEO薪酬将会相形见绌。

论证判断，围绕判断的可信度，是如此的关键。沃伦•巴菲特(Warren Buffett)之所以胜出，是因为他拥有巨大的可信度。他非常负责任。他一遍又一遍地出现在公共领域。他为人正直，所以你可以信任他。

像这样的人，人们会因为他的判断而给他无限的筹码。没有人问他工作有多努力;没有人问他什么时候醒来，什么时候睡觉。他们说，“沃伦，做你自己的事。”

**判断，尤其是表现出来的判断，具有高度的责任感，清晰的记录，是至关重要的。**

## **判断是知道你的行为的长期后果**

尼维:让我们来定义一下判断。**我把它定义为知道你的决定的长期影响，或者能够预测你的决定的长期影响。**

纳瓦尔:这很有趣。我对智慧的定义是知道你的行为的长期后果，所以它们并没有那么不同。智慧只是对个人领域的判断。

我认为把智慧运用到外部问题上就是判断。它们高度相关。但是，是的，**它是知道你的行为的长期后果，然后做出正确的决定来利用它。**

## **没有经验，判断往往是没有用的**

判断是很难建立的。这就是智力和经验发挥作用的地方。

所谓在象牙塔里的知识分子有很多问题，但纳西姆•塔勒布(Nassim Taleb)之所以对他们横加指责，原因之一与象牙塔无关。他们没有现实世界的经验，他们只是单纯地运用智力。

智慧没有任何经验往往无用,因为你得到智慧的信心,你得到一些信誉,但是因为你没有skin in the game,你没有实际经验,没有真正的责任,你只是掷飞镖。

现实世界总是远比我们想象的要复杂得多。尤其是所有有趣的、快速移动的边缘领域和问题，没有经验你是无法做到的。如果你很聪明，而且迭代速度很快，你就不会在某件事上花费1万个小时，而是在某件事上花费1万个尝试。

## **最有判断力的人属于最不情绪化的人**

如果你很聪明，你做过很多快速的迭代，你试着把你的情绪排除在外，你会认识到那些有最好判断力的人实际上是最不情绪化的。在这方面，很多最优秀的投资者几乎都被认为是机械呆板的，但是最优秀的企业家也常常表现得缺乏情感，我对此不会感到惊讶。

有一种典型的充满激情的企业家，是的，他们必须关心自己在做什么，但他们也必须非常清楚地看到实际发生了什么。阻止你看到真实情况的是你的情绪。我们的情绪不断地模糊我们的判断，在投资、经营公司、制造产品或成为一名企业家时，情绪真的会成为障碍。不要贪婪，不要愤怒，单纯的做判断。

情感是阻止你看到正在发生的事情的东西，直到你再也无法抗拒正在发生的事情的真相，直到它变得太突然，然后你被迫陷入痛苦;这打破了你之前的幻想。

尼维:为了把这些概念联系起来，我想说的是，首先，你要对自己的判断负责。审判是智慧的运行。智慧来自经验;这种体验可以通过短迭代来加速。

## **许多顶级投资者听起来常常像哲学家**

纳瓦尔:为什么很多的投资者,很多价值投资者,就像如果你读杰里米•格兰瑟姆或者你读沃伦·巴菲特,或者你读读迈克尔·巴里,这些人听起来像哲学家,或者是他们阅读过大量的哲学书，历史书和科学书。

他们在做什么，他们不应该读投资书籍吗?不。投资书籍是最不适合学习投资的地方，因为投资是一项现实世界的活动，具有高度的多变量性，所有的优势总是被竞争殆尽。它总是走在最前沿。

你真正需要的是非常广泛的判断和思考。最好的方法是学习一切，包括哲学。哲学也会让你变得更坚忍，让你变得不那么情绪化，所以你会做出更好的决定;有更好的判断力。

## **一个人越愤怒，他的判断力就越差**

有一件很简单的事，我在推特上看到，似乎有一半的推特用户一直对某些事情感到愤怒。你可以进入某人的推特账号，至少能在一定程度上了解到他们脑子里一直在想什么。

我向你保证，一个人越愤怒，他的判断力就越差。如果有人不断在推特上表达政治愤怒，就像一个愤怒的人在打架一样，你不会想把车钥匙交给这个人，更不用说公司的钥匙了。
# **27. 设定一个理想的小时费率**

如果外包一项任务的成本低于你的时薪，那就把它外包出去。

## **设定并执行理想的每小时收费（比如每分钟10块钱）**

尼维:我们涵盖了你致富所需的技能。那就是特殊知识、责任感、影响力、判断力和终身学习。让我们谈谈努力工作和珍惜时间的重要性。

纳瓦尔:没有人会比你更看重自己。你只需要设置一个非常高的个人小时费率，你必须坚持它。即使从我年轻的时候起，我就认为我的价值远远超过市场，尽管我的价值，但我开始这样对待自己。

每次做决定都要把时间考虑进去。要花多少时间?哦，我要花一个小时才能穿过市区拿到这个东西。我对自己的估价是每小时100美元;这相当于从我口袋里掏出100美元。我要这么做吗?

你从亚马逊买东西;他们把它搞砸了，你得还回去。你花时间还它值得吗?这样的精神折磨值得吗?记住，你的工作时间越少，你的高精神产出时间就越少。你是想用它们来跑腿解决小问题，还是想把它们存起来做大事?

所有伟大的科学家都不善于管理他们的家庭生活。他们中没有一个人有一个干净整洁的房间，没有一个人按时完成所有的社交活动，也没有人寄感谢信。

## **你不能因小失大还能致富**

你可以随心所欲地度过你的一生，但如果你想变得富有，它必须是你最强烈的愿望。也就是说，它必须排在其他事物之前;这意味着你不能小气。这是人们所不理解的。

你可以省吃俭用来维持基本的生活。你可以把开支控制在低水平，也许早点退休，不要花太多钱。这是完全有效的。但我们在这里讨论的是财富创造。如果你要这么做，那么这必须是你的首要任务。

## **我的理想工资是每小时5000美元，你呢？**

快进到你富有的自我，选择一些中等时薪。信不信由你，对我来说，回到你本可以雇用我的时候，现在你显然不能，但回到你本可以雇用我的时候，这在十年前是真的，甚至在二十年前，在我还没有真正的钱之前。我过去常常对自己说，我的时薪是每小时5000美元。今天当我回头看的时候，真的是每小时5000美元。

当然，我最终还是会做一些愚蠢的事情，比如和电工争吵，或者把坏了的扬声器还给他，但我不应该这么做，而且我做的比我的任何朋友都少。我会把一些东西扔进垃圾桶里，或者捐给救世军，而不是试图把它归还，或者把一些东西交给人们，而不是试图修理它。

我会和我的女朋友们争论，即使是我的妻子，“我不会那样做。那不是我能解决的问题。当我妈妈递给我一些待办事项时，我仍然会和她争论。我就是不这么做。我宁愿雇给你一个助手。即使在我没有钱的时候也是这样。

## **如果你能以低于小时工资的价格外包一些东西，那就去做**

另一种思考的方式是，如果你可以外包一些事情或者不做一些低于你的小时工资的事情，外包或者不做。如果你能以低于你的时薪雇人做这件事，那就雇人吧。甚至包括烹饪。你可能想要吃健康的家常菜，但如果你可以外包，那就做吧。

我知道有些人会说，“那么生活的乐趣呢?按照你自己的方式把事情做好怎么样?“当然，你可以这么做，但你不会变得富有，因为现在你已经把其他事情放在了首位。

Paul Graham基本上对Y Combinator的创业公司说得很好，他说，“你应该致力于你的产品，让产品适合市场。你应该锻炼和健康饮食。“就是这样。你在执行任务的时候就只有这些时间了。

## **你的时薪应该高得离谱**

为自己设定一个非常高的每小时期望率，并坚持下去。它看起来和感觉都应该非常高。如果没有，就不够高。不管你选什么，我给你的建议是把它提出来。就像我说的，对我自己来说，甚至在我有钱之前，我设定了每小时5000美元的时间收费。如果你把它推演成年薪的样子，那就是每年几百万美元。

讽刺的是，我实际上认为我已经超过了这个数字。我不是工作最努力的人;我其实是个懒人。我通过爆发的能量来工作，在那里我真的被某件事激励着。如果我看看我每小时投入的实际收入，可能会比这个高很多。



# **28. 尽你所能地努力工作**

尽你所能地努力工作。即使你在做什么，和谁一起工作更重要。

## **尽你所能地努力工作**

纳瓦尔:让我们谈谈努力工作。推特上经常发生这样的争论，你是否应该努力工作。David Hauser(更正:David Heinemeier Hansson)说:“这就像你在驱赶奴隶。Keith Rabois总是说，“不，所有伟大的创始人都是拼命工作的。”

他们在互相交谈。首先，他们在谈论两件不同的事情。大卫谈论的是员工和生活方式的生意，这很好。如果你这么做了，你生活中最重要的一件事就是不要变得富有。你有一份工作，你也有你的家庭，你也有你的生活。

基思说的是创业的奥林匹克。他说的是一个追求金牌的人，试图建立一个数十亿美元的上市公司。那个人必须把每件事都做好。他们必须有很好的判断力。他们必须选择正确的工作。他们必须招募正确的团队，他们必须疯狂地努力工作。他们基本上是在进行竞争冲刺。

如果致富是你的目标，你将不得不尽你所能地努力工作。但是，努力工作绝对不能替代与你一起工作的人和你所从事的工作。你的工作可能是最重要的。

## **更重要的是你在做什么，以及和谁一起工作**

马克•安德森(Marc Andreessen)定义了产品市场契合度(Product-Market- founder Fit)，并提出了产品市场契合度(Product-Market Fit)。我将添加Product-Market-Founder Fit，这是您个人对该业务的适合程度。这三者的结合，应该是你压倒一切的目标。

如果你选择了正确的工作领域，你可以节省很多时间。接下来最重要的是选择合适的人一起工作。第三是你工作有多努力。它们就像凳子的三条腿;如果你少找一个，整个凳子就会掉下来。你不可能那么容易就挑出一个。

当你建立一个企业，甚至建立你的职业生涯时，首先要考虑的是，“我应该做什么?”什么是新兴市场?有一种产品，我可以创造它，我很兴奋地工作，我有特殊知识，我真的很喜欢它?”

第二，尽可能地和最好的人在一起，无论你的目标有多高，都要提高你的目标。你可以和其他足够优秀的人一起工作。有更伟大的人可以一起工作，你应该和他们一起工作。

我给很多人提供建议，他们都在考虑在硅谷加入哪家创业公司。我说:“基本上，选择一个在未来能够为你提供最好校友网络的公司。“看看贝宝黑手党。他们和一群天才一起工作，所以他们都很富有。试着根据你能找到的最聪明、最有活力、最正直的人来挑选。

最后，一旦你选择了正确的事情去做，选择了正确的人一起工作，那么你就会尽你所能地努力工作。

## **没有人真正每周工作80小时**

这就是神话变得有点疯狂的地方。每周工作80或120小时的人，很多都只是地位的信号。这是在炫耀。没有人真的每周工作80到120个小时，还能保持头脑清醒的高产出。你的大脑崩溃了。你只是没有好主意。

实际上，人们工作效率最高的方式，尤其是在知识型工作中，是他们在做某件事的时候尽他们所能地冲刺，他们受到鼓舞，充满激情;然后他们休息。他们休息很长时间。

**这更像是狮子狩猎，而不是马拉松赛跑。你冲刺，然后休息，重新评估，然后再试一次。**

**你最终要做的就是跑马拉松。**

## **灵感易腐**

尼维只是向我指出了一点，灵感是容易腐烂的，这是一个很好的观点。当你有了灵感，就立刻去做。这种情况经常发生在我的tweetstorm上。事实上，除了那些已经存在的推特风暴，我还推出了一大堆其他的推特风暴，但有时我只是犹豫，或者只是暂停，然后它就消失了。

我学到的是，如果我受到启发想写一篇博客或发布一篇推特风暴，我可能应该马上去做。否则，它就不会来了;我不会再讲这个了。灵感是一种美丽而强大的东西，当你拥有它的时候，抓住它。

## **对行动要不耐烦，对结果要有耐心**

人们谈论不耐烦。你什么时候知道要不耐烦?你什么时候知道要有耐心?我在twitter上对此的评论是:“对行动不耐烦，对结果保持耐心。”“我认为这实际上是一种很好的人生哲学。

任何你必须做的事，都要完成。为什么等待?你不再年轻了。你的生命正在消逝。你不想花时间排队。你不会想把时间花在来回旅行上。**你不想把时间花在你知道最终不是你使命的事情上。**

当你做这些事情的时候，你要尽可能快地去做，同时你要全神贯注地把它们做好。但你不得不放弃结果;你必须对结果保持耐心，因为你要处理复杂的系统，你要处理很多人。

**市场采用产品需要很长时间。人们需要时间来适应彼此的工作。好产品的诞生需要时间，因为你需要不断打磨。对行动要有耐心，对结果要有耐心。正如尼维所说，灵感是易逝的。当你有了灵感，立即行动起来。**

如果我在自己的某项业务中发现了一个需要解决的问题，我基本上不会睡觉，直到至少解决方案开始实施。这只是个人的事务，但如果我是一家公司的董事会成员，我会打电话给CEO。如果我在经营公司，我会打电话给我的下级经理。如果我有责任，我就去那里，马上去那里，解决它。

如果我不能在问题发生的那一刻解决它，或者当它发生的时候我没有开始着手解决它，我就不会安宁。我不会休息。在问题解决之前，我不会开心;所以尽快解决它。

在问题解决之前我是不会睡觉的。也许这只是一个人的特点，但在商业中却很管用。


# **29. 忙得没时间“喝咖啡”？**

你应该忙于“喝咖啡”，同时保持一个整洁的日历。

## **忙得连“喝咖啡”的时间都没有，同时还要保持日历的整洁**

纳瓦尔:我们浪费时间在被1000次削减的死亡上。我的另一条推特是，“你应该忙得连喝咖啡的时间都没有，同时还要保持日历的整洁。”“认识我的人都知道，我以同时做两件事而闻名。一个是有一个非常干净的日历。一个是我几乎没有开会讨论这个问题。

我遇到的一些人，当他们看到我的日历时，他们几乎要哭了，而与此同时，我一直很忙。我总是在做一些事情。这通常是“与工作相关”的，但它是在那个时候需要做的最具影响力的事情，也是我最感兴趣或最受启发的事情。但要做到这一点，唯一的办法就是不断无情地拒绝会议。

人们喜欢喝咖啡，建立人际关系，这在你职业生涯的早期很好，那时你还在探索。但在你的职业生涯后期，当你在剥削别人的时候，有更多的事情等着你，你不得不无情地把会议从你的生活中剔除。

如果有人想要开会，看看你能不能打电话代替。如果他们想打电话，看看他们是否可以用电子邮件来代替。如果他们想用电子邮件，看看他们是否可以用短信代替。如果他们在发短信，你可能应该忽略大多数短信，除非它们是紧急的，真正的紧急情况。

一个人必须完全无情地避开会议。当你开会的时候，步行会议，站立会议。保持简短，保持可执行，保持简短。任何八个人围坐在会议桌前开会，都不会有任何结果。你一次只能死一个小时。

尼维:“喝咖啡”让我想起了史蒂夫·乔布斯的一句名言，当时有人问他，“嘿，苹果为什么不参加大会?”或者“你为什么不来参加我的会议?”他的回答是:“那是因为我们不会在这里工作。”

纳瓦尔:对，我以前很难拒绝别人参加会议，但现在我直接告诉他们。我只是说，“看，我不做非事务性会议。没有严格的日程安排，我是不会开会的。除非绝对有必要，否则我不会开会。”

尼维以前就是这么做的。他会在人们要求我和尼维一起喝咖啡的时候给他们发电子邮件，来了解你。他会说，“我们不开会，除非事关生死。然后那个人基本上要回答，“是的，这是生死攸关的紧急事件”，或者根本就没有见面。

## **当你有工作证明时，人们会和你见面**

当你有重要或有价值的事情时，其他忙碌有趣的人会和你见面。你的名片必须是:“嘿，这就是我所做的。这是我可以给你看的。我们见面吧，如果这对你有用的话，我将尊重你的时间。”

我发现有很多很忙很重要的人会来参加你的会议，但是你必须带着一张合适的名片。所有那些发推特或电子邮件给名人或富人说，“嘿，如果我能和你见一次面”的人，他们对此含糊其辞，他们在生活中不会有任何进展。

你必须建立信誉。例如，当一个科技企业和风险企业的投资者看到一家初创公司时，他们首先想看到的是，他们想看到一些产品进步的证据。他们不只是想看到幻灯片，**他们想看到产品进步，因为产品进步是企业家的简历。**这是一份不可动摇、不可动摇的简历。

你必须做这项工作。要使用数字货币类比，你必须有工作证明。如果你有工作证明，而且你确实有一些有趣的东西，那么你应该毫不犹豫地把它们放在一封电子邮件里，然后发给别人。即使这样，当你要求开会的时候，你也想要有很强的可操作性。

## **即使在你职业生涯的早期，人脉也被高估了**

我要说的是，即使你自己还没有成功，如果你认为你可以通过外出、建立关系网、参加一系列会议来成功，那么你很可能是错的。是的，人际关系在你职业生涯的早期是很重要的，你也可以在会议中获得意外的收获，但几率非常低。

正如我们之前讨论过的，当你只是遇见一些人，希望得到好运的时候，你依靠的是第一类运气，也就是盲目的运气，和第二类运气，也就是匆忙的运气。

但你得不到的，是第三种或第四种运气，这是更好的一种。你花时间建立声誉，为某事工作;培养一种独特的观点，能够发现别人无法发现的机会。

一个忙碌的日程表和一个忙碌的大脑会摧毁你在这个世界上做大事的能力。如果你想做伟大的事情，无论你是音乐家、企业家还是投资者，你都需要自由的时间和自由的思想。



# **30.重新定义你的工作，直到梦想成真**

在你所做的事情上成为世界上最好的。不断地重新定义你所做的，直到这是真的。

## **不断地重新定义你所做的，直到你最擅长你所做的**

尼维:我们刚刚讨论了努力工作和珍惜时间的重要性。接下来是一些关于长期工作的推文。第一条推特是:“做世界上最好的自己。”不断重新定义你所做的，直到这是真的。”

纳瓦尔:如果你真的想在这个世界上赚钱，无论你在做什么，你都想成为第一。这是利基市场，这就是重点。它可以是字面上的意思，你做你自己，就能得到报酬。

在这一点上，世界上一些更成功的人就是这样。**奥普拉因为成为奥普拉而得到报酬。乔·罗根因为扮演乔·罗根而得到报酬。他们对自己很真实。**

所以这条推特同时想说的是，你想成为第一，但你想不断改变你的行为，直到你成为第一。你不能随便选一个。你不能说，“我要成为世界上跑得最快的人，现在你要打败尤塞恩·博尔特。”这太难了。

你能做的是不断改变你的目标，直到它契合你的特定知识，你的技能，你的职位，你的能力，你的位置，你的兴趣。然后收敛到1。

当你搜索要做什么的时候，你实际上有两个不同的焦点，你必须时刻记住。其中之一就是，“我想在我所做的事情上做到最好。”第二个是，“我所做的是灵活的，所以我是最擅长的。”

直到你到达一个舒适的地方，在那里，“是的，这是一件我可以做得很棒的事情，同时我仍然是真实的自己。”“**这不会是一夜之间的发现。这将是一个漫长的旅程，但至少你现在知道如何去思考它。**

## **找到founder-product-market适合的位置**

对一个公司来说，最重要的是找到适合产品市场的产品。我想说，对于创业者来说，最重要的是找到适合自己的创始人、产品和市场。你很自然地倾向于开发出有市场的产品。这是三个重点问题。也就是说你要让这三个同时工作。

如果你想在生活中取得成功，你需要适应同时处理多个变量的问题和多个目标函数。在这种情况下，你必须同时绘制至少两到三幅地图。

# **31. 通过真实逃避竞争**

竞争会让你玩错游戏。没有人能和你竞争成为你自己。

## **竞争会让你陷入一场不那么精彩的比赛**

尼维:这让我想起你在推特上说的通过真实性来逃避竞争。这听起来像是在寻找你是谁。

纳瓦尔:这既是一种探索，也是一种认可，因为有时当我们探索自我时，我们想要成为与自己不同的人。我们的朋友和家人更擅长告诉我们我们是谁，或者回顾我们做过的事更好的指示我们是谁。

彼得•泰尔(Peter Thiel)谈了很多关于竞争的内容。这是适得其反。我们是高度模因化的生物，我们复制周围其他人在做的事情。我们从他们身上复制我们的欲望。

如果我周围的每个人都是伟大的艺术家，我想成为一名艺术家。如果我周围的每个人都是一个伟大的商人，我想成为一个商人。如果我周围的每个人都是社会活动家，我想成为一个社会活动家。这就是我自尊的来源。

当你陷入这些地位游戏时，你必须小心一点，你最终会为不值得竞争的东西而竞争。Peter Thiel谈到他将如何成为一名法律助理，因为他在法学院，他周围的人都想成为最高法院法官或著名法官的法律助理。他被拒绝了，这就是他从商的原因。**它帮助他从一场较小的比赛中脱颖而出，进入一场更大的比赛。**

所以,有时候你被困在错误的游戏，因为你陷于竞争,最好的方法逃避竞争,摆脱竞争的幽灵,这不仅仅是压力巨大和非常伤脑筋的，还将推动你走向错误的答案。逃避竞争的方式是对自己保持真实。

## **没有人能和你竞争成为你自己**

如果你从根本上构建和营销的东西只是你自身的延伸，那么在这一点上没有人能与你竞争。谁将与乔·罗根或斯科特·亚当斯竞争?这是不可能的。会不会有其他人来写一本更好的呆伯特?不，有人会和比尔·沃特森竞争创造一个更好的加尔文和霍布斯吗，不。他们是真实的。

这在艺术中是最容易看到的。根据定义，艺术家都是自然真实的。但即使是企业家也是真实的。谁将成为埃隆·马斯克，谁将成为杰克·多西?这些人是真实的，他们创造的企业和产品是真实的，符合他们的欲望和他们的手段。

如果有人来发射火箭，我想伊隆一点也不会担心。他仍然要去火星，因为那是他的使命，尽管看起来很疯狂，那是他为自己设定的目标，他要完成它。

所以，真实性自然会让你远离竞争。这是否意味着你一定想要真实到没有适合产品市场的程度?也许你是独轮车上玩杂耍的高手，但即使是在YouTube视频网站上，也没有那么大的市场。所以你必须调整它，直到你找到适合产品市场的产品。

但至少要倾向于真实性，远离竞争。竞争会自动导致抄袭，而且往往会导致完全错误的游戏。

## **在企业家精神中，大众永远不会是正确的**

尤其是在创业方面，大众永远不会是正确的。如果你看到很多人在推特上谈论下一个伟大的市场是什么，或者你看到记者谈论一个公司是可怕的，他们什么都不知道。如果大众知道如何建造伟大的东西，创造巨大的财富，我们都已经完成了。我们现在都已经很富有了。

所以，从某种意义上说，当你看到很多竞争的时候，有时这向你表明，大众已经在这里了，所以竞争已经太激烈了，**这里什么都没有，或者这是一个错误的趋势。**

另一方面，如果它是完全空的，如果整个市场是空的，没有人在那里，这也可能是一个警告信号，表明你在产品-市场契合度方面做得太过真实，而在创始人-产品-市场契合度方面做得不够。

所以有一个平衡。你必须找到它。但一般来说，大多数人都会犯这样的错误，过于关注竞争过于喜欢竞争，却不够真实，而伟大的创始人往往是真正的打破传统的人。

## **把你的职业和业余爱好结合起来**

尼维:我不想再提斯科特·亚当斯的技巧了，但我还是要提一下。你认为的真实性的方法之一是通过不时增加一些随机技能,你认为可能是重要,但只是发现五六各种技能,你已经真正的拥有,只是堆积在彼此,甚至不需要任何有目的的方式。如果你在表达你是谁，无论如何你都要表达所有这五六个不同的技能。

纳瓦尔:**无论如何，那才是生活真正要带你去的地方。**从长远来看，如果你在你所做的事情上做得很好很成功，你会发现无论你的爱好是什么，你几乎都是为了谋生。正如罗伯特·弗罗斯特所说，把你的职业和你的业余爱好结合起来。你喜欢做什么，你乐于做什么，就做什么。所以我想你无论如何都会找到你自己。

你对技能的掌握是正确的。每个人都有多种技能，我们并不是一维的生物，即使这是我们如何在我们的在线个人资料中描绘自己来获得工作。你遇到一个人，他们说，“我是一个银行家。或者，“我是酒保。”或者“我是理发师。”“你有什么，所有的。

人是多元的。他们有很多技能。一个银行家可能擅长金融，另一个可能擅长销售。第三个可能只是擅长宏观经济趋势，对市场有感觉。另一个人可能非常擅长挑选个股。另一个可能只是善于维持关系，而不是建立新的关系。每个人都会有不同的利基市场，而且你会有多个利基市场，而不是只有一个。

因此，随着时间的推移，你会发现，在你的职业生涯中，你会被自己擅长的事情所吸引，而这些事情基本上都是你喜欢做的，否则你就不会擅长它们。你不会花时间的。

其他人会把你推向你擅长的领域，因为你聪明的老板，聪明的同事，聪明的投资者会意识到，“好吧，你在这方面确实是世界级的，你会用另一件事招聘别人。所以，最理想的情况是，**你成为你自己。**

1. **玩愚蠢的游戏，就会赢得愚蠢的奖品**

竞争会使你看不到更伟大的比赛。你离更好的市场只有一步之遥。

## **那些看起来处于直接竞争中的企业实际上并没有**

尼维:我认为当你做真实的自己时，你不会那么在意竞争。是的，它会让你生气，它会激发你的恐惧、嫉妒和其他随之而来的情绪，但你并不介意，因为你更倾向于目标和任务，最坏的情况是，你会从中得到一些想法。通常有一些方法可以与竞争以一种积极的方式合作，它最终会为你扩大市场规模。

纳瓦尔:对，有时这取决于公司的性质。硅谷科技行业的企业往往是赢家通吃。至少是好的。所以当你看到竞争时，它会让你勃然大怒，因为它真的会危及你所建造的一切。

然而，如果我开了一家餐馆，而同一家餐馆的一个更有趣的版本在另一个城镇开张了，那就太棒了，我就从他们那里把行得通的东西拿出来，把他们已经发现行不通的东西扔掉。所以这在一定程度上取决于企业的性质。

也就是说，即使是那些看起来经常处于直接竞争中的企业实际上也不是。它们可以相邻，也可以略有不同。**你离一个完全不同的行业只有一步之遥，有时你需要迈出这一步，但如果你正忙于争夺一个傻瓜奖，你就无法迈出这一步。**

你在玩一个愚蠢的游戏，你将赢得一个愚蠢的奖品。现在还不明显，因为你被竞争蒙蔽了双眼，但三年后就会很明显了。

## **我的第一家公司卷入了一场错误的游戏**

给一个简单的例子,当我第一次开始公司,我的第一个公司叫Epinions。这是一个在线产品评论网站。所有产品是亚马逊和独立的企业的。最终目标是变成TripAdvisor和Yelp。

我们本应该做更多的本地评论，因为对本地餐厅这样的稀缺商品进行评论更有价值。像对相机这样的商品进行评论，在亚马逊上有1000条评论。

但在我们到达那里之前，我们已经陷入了整个比较购物游戏，所以我们最终与DealTime合并，并与mySimon和Bizrate竞争，这两家公司后来成为Shopzilla和PriceGrabber, NexTag以及一系列价格比较引擎。我们都陷入了激烈的竞争中，整个空间都变成了零，因为事实证明亚马逊完全赢得了电子长尾。所以没有必要比较价格，每个人都去了亚马逊。

但我们获得了booby奖，因为我们在与一群同行的竞争中陷入了困境，而我们本应该关注消费者真正想要的是什么，并对自己诚实，关注评论，而不是价格比较。并且越来越多地进入到越来越深奥的项目中，这些项目需要被审查，而客户拥有的数据越来越少，而且更迫切地需要审查。如果我们做真实的自己，我们会做得更好。

# **33. 最终你会得到你应得的**

运用特殊知识，最终你会得到你应得的。

## **在足够长的时间范围内，你会得到报酬**

尼维:我们还在讨论长期工作的问题，下一条关于这个话题的推文是“用杠杆，运用特殊知识，最终你会得到你应得的。”“我还想补充一点，那就是运用判断力、责任感和阅读技巧。

纳瓦尔:这只是一个油嘴滑舌的说法，它需要时间，即使你把所有这些东西都准备好了，你要投入的时间也是不确定的。如果你在数，你会在它真正到来之前就失去耐心。

所以你只要确保你给这些东西一个合适的时间，生命是漫长的，查理·芒格对此有一些看法。有人问他关于赚钱的事，他重新解释了这个问题，他说提问者实际上问的是，“我怎样才能像你一样变得富有，但在我成为真正的老人之前?”

每个人都想立刻得到它，但世界是一个高效的地方，这是行不通的。你必须投入时间。你必须投入时间。所以我认为你只需要特殊知识,把自己放在这个职位的责任,与杠杆。你需要真实的技能,你必须在你世界是最好的。

然后你必须享受它，不断地做，不断地做，不断地做，不要跟踪，不要计算，因为如果你做了，你就会耗尽时间。我可以回顾我的职业生涯，回想20年前那些我认为聪明、勤奋的人，但没有想太多，他们现在都成功了，几乎没有例外。

在足够长的时间范围内，你确实会得到报酬，但很容易是10年或20年。有时候是5点，如果是5点或3点，你的一个朋友来了，你会发疯的。但是，这些都是例外。每一个成功者都会经历多次失败。

创业中很重要的一件事就是你必须至少做对一次。你有很多很多的射门机会。你可以每三到五年就瞄准一个目标，也许是最慢的每10年一次，或者是最快的每年一次，这取决于你如何迭代你的创业公司，但你真的只需要正确一次。

## **你真正擅长的是什么?**

尼:我的小公式是，你的最终结果就等于您的特定知识*时代的特殊性（利用您可以应用的这些知识多少次）*多长时间*你的判断是正确的*你负的责任*乘以多少社会价值你能做到。然后你把所有这些和你能坚持多久，以及你能通过阅读和学习提高多久结合起来。

纳瓦尔:这实际上是一个很好的总结方法。甚至可以试着画出这个方程。

也就是说，人们试图将数学应用到真正的哲学中。我以前见过这种情况，我说了一件事，然后又说了另一件事，如果你把它当作数学方程的话，它似乎是矛盾的。

但这显然是在不同的背景下，然后人们会说，“你说欲望是痛苦的，”你知道，佛教的说法，然后你说，“所有的伟大都来自痛苦。”那么，这是否意味着所有的伟大都来自于欲望呢?“这不是数学领域的人，你不能带着变量到处跑，形成绝对的逻辑输出。你必须知道什么时候应用。

我认为这是非常有用的理解，但与此同时，不能过于分析它。这就是物理学家所说的假精度。当你把两个虚构的估计值相乘得到4个精度，这些小数点实际上不算数。你没有这些数据。你没有那样的知识。在模型中，估计的变量越多，模型中的错误就越大。

所以，给你的决策过程增加越来越多的复杂性实际上会得到一个更糟的答案。你最好只挑一两件最大的。例如，根据我的观察，根据我信任的人，根据市场价值，我真正擅长什么?

单独这两个变量就足够了。因为如果你擅长它，你就能保持下去。如果你很擅长，你就会发展自己的判断力。如果你擅长并且喜欢做，最终人们会给你资源，你就不会害怕承担责任。所以其他的部分都会落在合适的位置。

如果你正在做你喜欢做的事情，而市场又想要它，那么产品与市场的契合是不可避免的。

# **34. 拒绝大部分的建议**

大多数建议是人们给你他们中奖的彩票号码。

## **最好的创业者会听取每个人的意见，但要自己拿主意**

尼维:关于那个五年内变富的人，你在剪辑室里听到的一条推文是:避开那些一夜暴富的人，他们只是把中奖彩票号码给了你。

纳瓦尔:不管怎么说，这通常是正确的建议，回到斯科特亚当斯，他说关注系统而不是目标。如果你经常问一个特定的人什么对他们有用，他们读出来的一套对他们有用的东西可能并不适用于你。他们只是在给你念他们中奖的彩票号码。

这有点油嘴滑舌。我们可以从他们身上学到一些东西。但你不能把他们的真实情况映射到你的身上。我所认识的最好的创业者，他们会倾听和阅读每个人的想法。但是他们忽视了所有人。他们自己做决定。

他们有自己的内在模式，知道如何将事情应用到自己的处境中，他们会毫不犹豫地抛弃冗余信息。如果你调查了足够多的人，所有的建议都会被取消为零。

你必须有自己的观点，当你收到某样东西时，你必须迅速做出决定，这是真的吗?在那个人应用它的背景之外，这是真的吗?在我的语境中，这是真的吗?然后我想应用它吗?你必须拒绝大多数建议，但你必须倾听和阅读足够多的建议，知道什么该拒绝，什么该接受。

即使在本播客中，你也应该检查所有的东西。如果有些事情让你感觉不真实，放下它，把它放在一边。如果你觉得有太多不真实的东西，删除这个播客。

## **建议是你可以回忆起来的格言，当你有了自己的经验**

尼维:我认为接受建议最危险的地方是，给你建议的人不会再告诉你什么时候它不再适用了。

纳瓦尔:我认为建议的目的与大多数人以为的略有不同。我只是把它看作是帮助我获得轶事和格言，当我有了自己的直接经验后，我可以回忆起来，说:“啊，那就是那个人的意思。”

90%的推文是格言,我自己重新雕刻,然后这些小精神钩子会再次提醒我，当我处在这种情况下,说,“哦,我在推特听过,如果你不能看到自己与某人的生活一生,那就不要与他们工作了一天。“所以，一旦我知道这个人10年后不会和我一起工作，那么我就必须开始把自己从这段关系中解脱出来，或者不再在这段关系上投入太多精力。”

所以，我用我的推文和其他人的推文作为格言，帮助我压缩自己学习的信息，以便能够回忆起它们。大脑的空间是有限的，你有有限的神经元，所以你几乎可以把这些看作是指针，地址，助记符来帮助你记住深层的原则，如果你有潜在的经验来支持它。

如果你没有基本的经验，那么它读起来就像一堆引言。它很酷，一时很鼓舞人心，也许你可以用它做一个漂亮的海报，然后你就会忘记它，继续前进。所以，所有这些都是你回忆自己知识的简洁方法。

# **35. 真正重要的是：一颗平静的心，一个健康的身体，一个充满爱的房子**

当你最终变得富有时，你会意识到这并不是你最初想要的。

## **当你富有的时候，你会发现这并不是你想要的**

尼维:关于长期工作的最后一条推文是这样说的:“当你终于富有时，你会意识到这并不是你最初想要的。”但那是另一天的事了。”

纳瓦尔:这本身就是一个长达数小时的话题。首先，我认为这是一个非常聪明的方式来结束这一切，因为它解除了一群人的攻击，他们说，“致富的意义是什么?“因为有很多人喜欢地位信号、美德信号，反对创造财富或赚钱的想法。所以这是解除他们所有人武装的好方法。

但这也是真的。在生活中，你真正想要的东西，是的，钱会解决你所有的钱的问题，但它不会把你带到其他地方。

当你赚了一大笔钱后，你意识到的第一件事就是你还是那个人。如果你快乐，你就快乐。如果你不快乐，你就不快乐。如果你平静、满足、平和，你还是那个人。我认识很多非常富有的人，他们的身材非常差。我认识很多有钱人，他们的家庭生活很糟糕。我认识很多富人，他们的内心一团糟。

## **一个平静的头脑，一个健康的身体和一个充满爱的房子必须自己去赢得**

所以，我会提到我发布的另一条推特，当我回想起来，我觉得这是我最喜欢的一条推特。它不一定是最有洞察力的，也不一定是最有帮助的。它甚至不是我想得最多的一个，但当我看它的时候，它有如此确定的真理，它引起共鸣。那就是“平静的头脑，健康的身体和充满爱的房子。这些东西是买不到的。他们必须努力争取。”

即使你拥有世界上所有的钱，你也不可能拥有这三样东西。杰夫·贝佐斯仍然需要锻炼。他仍然要为他的婚姻或者他的下一段关系而努力。他的内在精神状态仍然不受外部事件的控制。这将取决于他内心有多平静。

所以我认为这三件事，你的健康，你的精神健康和你的亲密关系，是你必须培养的，可能会给你带来更多的和平和幸福，比任何金钱都多。

## **如何获得一个更平静的内部状态的实用建议**

这就是我的意思。现在，如何到达那里？实际上是一个tweetstorm，我仍然需要时间推出。我一直在努力。我大概有上百条推特。在这个话题上发表任何言论都很难不受到来自50个不同方向的攻击，尤其是最近在Twitter上。所以我一直在犹豫，因为我想要针对一个非常特殊的人。

有一群人不相信改善你的内在状态是有用的。他们过于关注外在。这很好，这没有什么错，他们应该这么做。有一群人相信，唯一值得做的事情就是彻底解脱，就像你成为佛陀一样，他们会攻击任何中间的东西，认为它们毫无用处。这也很好，但大多数人都不在那里。

所以，我想做的是创建一个推特风暴，这是一个非常实用的建议，对于每天想要有一个更平静的内部状态的人。一套关于理解，实现，半真半假的真理，如果你想正确地吸收它们，这些只是指向你已经拥有的想法和经历的指针。如果你把这些记在心里，慢慢地，但稳步地，它会帮助你实现某些目标，让你进入一个更平静的内心状态。这就是我想做的。

健身是另一个重要的方面，我不是这方面的专家。Twitter上有很多比我更健康的好人。

## **很多离婚都是因为钱，很多争吵都是因为内心的愤怒**

我认为一个充满爱的家庭和关系实际上会自然而然地从其他事情中脱离出来。如果你有一个冷静的头脑，如果你已经赚了钱，你应该有一个良好的关系。你没有理由不这么做。很多离婚都是因为钱的问题，不幸的是，这就是现实，所以有了钱就没有了这一部分。

很多外部冲突的发生是因为你的内部状态不好。当你的内心平和时，你就会减少争吵。你会变得更有爱心，而不期待任何回报，这样就能处理好外部关系方面的事情。

尼维:所以，钱能解决你的钱的问题。钱能让你在物质世界中获得自由，我想这是你在剪辑室发的一条推特，钱能让你不做你不想做的事情。

纳瓦尔:对我来说，金钱的最终目的是让你不必在特定的时间、特定的地点做任何你不想做的事情。



# **36. 没有快速致富的计划**

快速致富的计划只是别人从你身上致富。

## **没有快速致富的计划**

尼维:我们跳过了一条推文，因为我想涵盖所有关于长期话题的推文。我们跳过的那条推特是，“没有快速致富的计划。那只不过是别人从你这里发财罢了。”

纳瓦尔:这又回到了有效率的世界。如果有一种简单的致富方式，它已经被开发出来了。有很多人会向你推销如何赚钱的想法和计划，但他们总是卖给你一些79.95美元的课程或一些有声读物或研讨会。

这很好，每个人都需要吃。人们需要谋生。他们可能真的有很好的建议，但如果他们给你的是可行的、高质量的建议，承认这是一个艰难的旅程，会花费很多时间，那么我认为这是现实的。

但是，如果他们卖给你一些快速致富计划，无论是加密还是在线业务或研讨会，他们只是在从你身上赚钱。这就是他们的快速致富计划。它不一定对你有用。

我们没有广告，因为它会破坏我们的信誉

关于整个推特风暴和播客的一件事，是我们这里没有广告。我们不收任何费用。我们不卖任何东西。不是因为我不想赚更多的钱，赚更多的钱总是好的，我们在这里工作。但是，因为这将彻底摧毁企业的信誉。如果我说，“嘿，我知道如何致富，我要把它卖给你。“会毁了它。

当我年轻的时候，我研究过这个话题，我最喜欢的一本关于这个话题的书是Felix Dennis写的，《如何致富》，他是Maxim杂志的创始人，一位去世的亿万富翁。他有很多疯狂的东西，但他也有一些很好的见解。

但每当我读到他或GoDaddy创始人鲍勃·帕森斯或安德鲁·卡内基的作品时，你会读到一些已经非常富有的人写的东西，他们显然是在其他领域发家致富的，而不是通过销售《如何致富》(how to get rich)系列，他们有可信度。你可以相信他们。

他们不是想从你身上赚钱。他们显然是想要赢得一些地位和一些自尊，对吧，你总是要有做事情的动机。但是，至少这是他们没有撒谎的一个更清晰的原因。他们可能不是在骗你。

## **每个创始人都必须对每个员工撒谎**

在某种程度上，每个创始人都必须对公司的每一位员工撒谎。他们必须说服他们，为我工作比做我做过的事，为自己工作要好。所以我一直很难接受。

这就是为什么在我的公司里，为了诚实，我招募了一些企业家，我告诉他们，“你们将在这个公司成为企业家，当你们准备好开始自己的下一件事的时候，我会支持你们。我永远不会妨碍你创业。但这可能是一个好地方，让你学习如何构建一个良好的团队,建立一个好的文化,如何找到产品市场，完美适合你的技能，和遇到一些令人惊异的人。当你弄明白它到底是什么。因为定位、时机、深思熟虑,对开始一个公司很重要。”

但我从来没能做到的是看着他们的脸说:“你必须在早上8点之前到办公桌前。”“因为我不会在早上8点之前坐在办公桌前，我想要自由。或者告诉他们，你今天很擅长做董事，明天就会成为副总裁。把他们放在冰冷的职业道路上，因为我自己也不相信。

## **任何提供致富建议的人都应该在其他地方赚钱**

如果有人就如何致富给出建议，而且他们也在从中赚钱，那么他们应该从其他地方赚钱。你不会想从一个胖子身上学到如何保持健康。你不会想从一个抑郁的人身上学到如何快乐。所以，你不想从一个穷人那里学习如何致富，但你也不想从一个靠告诉别人如何致富来赚钱的人那里学习如何致富。这是可疑的。

尼维:当你看到有人按照大师的致富建议变得富有时，只要记住，在任何随机过程中，如果你运行的时间足够长，如果有足够多的人参与其中，你总会得到每一个可能的结果，而且概率是1。

纳瓦尔:这里面有很多随机的错误，这也是为什么当商业记者和经济学家学者谈论私营公司时，你必须完全忽视他们的原因。

我甚至不会指名道姓，但当一位著名经济学家对比特币大加抨击，或者当一名商业记者攻击最近一家即将上市的公司时，这完全是无稽之谈。这些人从来没有做过任何事情，他们是专业的评论家。他们对赚钱一无所知。他们只知道如何批评和获得页面浏览量。你读这些书的时候会变得越来越笨。

最后我想引用纳西姆·塔勒布的一句话，我喜欢他说的，“如果你想成为一个哲学家国王，先成为国王，然后成为哲学家。”不要先成为哲学家，然后成为国王。

尼维:我很高兴你提到了塔勒布，因为我本想说的是，记住他的第一本书的书名，这本书谈到大众如何被随机性愚弄了。

纳瓦尔:我们在这期播客中含糊不清的原因之一是，我们试图列出永恒的原则，而不是仅仅给出昨天中奖的彩票号码。

# **37. Productize你自己**

弄清楚你最擅长的是什么，并尽可能多地利用杠杆。

## **弄清楚你最擅长的是什么，并尽可能多地利用优势**

尼维:你用两个词概括了整个推特风暴。“Productize自己。”

纳瓦尔:生产和你自己。自己有独特性。Productize是杠杆。自己承担责任。产品化特殊知识。你自己也有特殊知识。所有这些，你可以把它们合并成这两个词。

无论你在做什么生意，如果你想长期致富，你应该问自己:“这是我的真实写照吗?”我所投射的是我自己吗?然后，“我在生产它吗?”我在Scale up吗?我是用劳动力、资本、代码还是媒体来扩大规模?所以这是一个非常方便、简单的助记符。

这是什么播客?这是一个叫做纳瓦尔的播客。我真的是在用播客提高自己的效率。

尼维:你想要弄清楚自己擅长什么，或者自己擅长什么，然后尽可能多地利用杠杆。所以赚钱不是你做的事，也不是一种技能。你是谁，被踩过无数次才会认识到。

## **找到能让你富有、健康和有创造力的爱好**

纳瓦尔:赚钱应该取决于你的身份和你喜欢做什么。另一条我很喜欢的推特是……这不是我的，是别人贴的。他们说“找三个爱好。一个能让你赚钱，一个能让你保持健康，一个能让你富有创造力。”

我会稍微改变一下。我会说一个让你赚钱，一个让你健康，一个让你更聪明。就我而言，让我聪明的爱好是阅读，因为我喜欢与初创公司合作，这是让我赚钱的爱好。要么投资，要么集思广益，要么开始行动。我喜欢创业初期的创意和创造阶段。

至于让你保持健康的爱好，我真的没有。最接近的是瑜伽，但那是我崩溃的地方。我认为，那些早年发现冲浪、游泳、网球或某种他们一生中大部分时间都在做的运动的人是非常幸运的，因为他们发现了一种爱好，这将使他们变得健康。

How to Get Rich: Every Episode
naval Podcast, Wealth June 3, 2019

Podcast: Apple · Spotify · Overcast · Download

This giant episode collects all of my interviews with Nivi on How to Get Rich. These interviews are based on my tweetstorm. The individual interviews are here. Here we go…

1. Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status

The difference between wealth, money and status.

Naval is a prolific tech investor and founder of AngelList

Nivi: You probably know Naval from his Twitter account.

We’re going to be talking about his tweetstorm on “How to get rich (without getting lucky).” We’re going to go through most of the tweets in detail, give Naval a chance to expand on them and generally riff on the topic. He’ll probably throw in some ideas that he hasn’t even published before.

Naval’s the co-founder of AngelList and Epinions. He’s also a prolific tech investor in companies like Twitter, Uber, and many more.

I’m the co-founder of AngelList with Naval. And I co-authored the Venture Hacks blog with him back in the day.

Naval: The How To Get Rich tweetstorm definitely hit a nerve and went viral. A lot of people say it was helpful and reached across aisles.

People outside of the tech industry, people in all walks of life, people want to know how to solve their money problems. Everyone vaguely knows that they want to be wealthy, but they don’t have a good set of principles to do it by.


Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep

Nivi: What’s the difference between wealth, money, and status?

Naval: Wealth is the thing that you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, that’s cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, that’s serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.

Even a house can be a form of wealth because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower use of productivity of land than doing some commercial enterprise.

So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.

Wealth buys your freedom

The reason you want wealth is because it buys you your freedom. So, you don’t have to wear a tie like a collar around your neck. So, you don’t have to wake up at 7:00 AM, and rush to work, and sit in commute traffic. So, you don’t have to waste away your entire life grinding all your productive hours away into a soulless job that doesn’t fulfill you.

So, the purpose of wealth is freedom. It’s nothing more than that. It’s not to buy fur coats, or drive Ferraris, or sail yachts, or jet around the world in your Gulfstream. That stuff gets really boring and really stupid, really fast. It’s really so that you are your own sovereign individual.

You’re not going to get that unless you really want it. The entire world wants it and the entire world is working hard at it.

To some extent it is competitive. It’s a positive sum game, but there are competitive elements to it. Because there’s a finite amount of resources right now in society. To get the resources to do what you want, you have to stand out.

Money is how we transfer wealth

Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time.

If I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work that you did in the past. Here’s a little IOU. Let’s call that money.”

That money gets debased because people steal the IOUs. The government prints extra IOUs. People renege on their IOUs. But money is trying to be a reliable IOU from society that you are owed something for something you, or someone who gave you the money, did in the past.

We can transfer these IOUs around. So, money is how we transfer wealth.

Status is your rank in the social hierarchy

There are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game. Because money is not going to solve all of your problems, but it’s going to solve all of your money problems. I think people know that. They realize that, so they want to make money.

But at the same time, many of them deep down believe that they can’t make it. They don’t want any wealth creation to happen. So, they virtue signal by attacking the whole enterprise by saying, “Well, making money is evil. You shouldn’t do it.”

But they’re actually playing the other game, which is the status game. They’re trying to be high status in the eyes of other people watching by saying, “Well, I don’t need money. We don’t want money.” 

Status is your ranking in the social hierarchy.

Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Everybody in the world can have a house. Because you have a house doesn’t take away from my ability to have a house. If anything, the more houses that are built, the easier it becomes to build houses, the more we know about building houses, and the more people that can have houses.

Wealth is a very positive sum game. We create things together. We’re starting this endeavor to create this piece of art that explains what we’re doing. At the end of it, something brand new will be created. It’s a positive sum game.

Status is a very old game

Status, on the other hand, is a zero-sum game. It’s a very old game. We’ve been playing it since monkey tribes. It’s hierarchical. Who’s number one? Who’s number two? Who’s number three? And for number three to move to number two, number two has to move out of that slot. So, status is a zero-sum game.

Politics is an example of a status game. Even sports is an example of a status game. To be the winner, there must be a loser. I don’t fundamentally love status games. They play an important role in our society, so we can figure out who’s in charge. But fundamentally, you play them because they’re a necessary evil.

On an evolutionary basis, if you go back thousands of years, status is a much better predictor of survival than wealth is. You couldn’t have wealth before the farming age because you couldn’t store things. Hunter-gatherers carried everything on their backs.

So, hunter-gatherers lived in entirely status based societies. Farmers started going to wealth-based societies. And the modern industrial economies are much more heavily wealth-based societies.

People creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games

There’s always a subtle competition going on between status and wealth. For example, when journalists attack rich people, or attack the technology industry, they’re really bidding for status. They’re saying, “No, the people are more important. And I, the journalist, represent the people, and therefore I am more important.”

The problem is that to win at a status game, you have to put somebody else down. That’s why you should avoid status games in your life because they make you into an angry combative person. You’re always fighting to put other people down, to put yourself and the people you like up.

Status games are always going to exist. There’s no way around it, but realize that most of the time, when you’re trying to create wealth, you’re getting attacked by someone else, and they’re trying to look like a goody-two shoes.

They’re trying to up their own status at your expense. They’re playing a different game. And it’s a worse game. It’s a zero-sum game, instead of a positive sum game.

2. Make Abundance for the World

Wealth isn’t about taking something from somebody else—it’s about creating abundance for the world.

Ethical wealth creation makes abundance for the world

Naval: I think there is this notion that making money is evil, right? It’s rooted all the way back down to “money is the root of all evil.” People think that the bankers steal our money. It’s somewhat true in that, in a lot of the world, there’s a lot of theft going on all the time.

The history of the world, in some sense, is this predator/prey relationship between makers and takers. There are people who go out and create things, and build things, and work hard on things.

Then there are people who come along with a sword, or a gun, or taxes, or crony capitalism, or Communism, or what have you. There’s all these different methods to steal.

Even in nature, there are more parasites than there are non-parasitical organisms. You have a ton of parasites in you, who are living off of you. The better ones are symbiotic, they’re giving something back. But there are a lot that are just taking. That’s the nature of how any complex system is built.

What I am focused on is true wealth creation. It’s not about taking money. It’s not about taking something from somebody else. It’s from creating abundance.

Obviously, there isn’t a finite number of jobs, or finite amount of wealth. Otherwise we would still be sitting around in caves, figuring out how to divide up pieces of fire wood, and the occasional dead deer.

Most of the wealth in civilization, in fact all of it, has been created. It got created from somewhere. It got created from people. It got created from technology. It got created from productivity. It got created from hard work. This idea that it’s stolen is this horrible zero-sum game that people who are trying to gain status play.

Everyone can be rich

But the reality is everyone can be rich. We can see that by seeing, that in the First World, everyone is basically richer than almost anyone who was alive 200 years ago.

200 years ago nobody had antibiotics. Nobody had cars. Nobody had electricity. Nobody had the iPhone. All of these things are inventions that have made us wealthier as a species.

Today, I would rather be a poor person in a First World country, than be a rich person in Louis the XIV’s France. I’d rather be a poor person today than aristocrat back then. That’s because of wealth creation.

The engine of technology is science that is applied for the purpose of creating abundance. So, I think fundamentally everybody can be wealthy.

This thought experiment I want you to think through is imagine if everybody had the knowledge of a good software engineer and a good hardware engineer. If you could go out there, and you could build robots, and computers, and bridges, and program them. Let’s say every human knew how to do that.

What do you think society would look like in 20 years? My guess is what would happen is we would build robots, machines, software and hardware to do everything. We would all be living in massive abundance.

We would essentially be retired, in the sense that none of us would have to work for any of the basics. We’d even have robotic nurses. We’d have machine driven hospitals. We’d have self-driving cars. We’d have farms that are 100% automated. We’d have clean energy.

At that point, we could use technology breakthroughs to get everything that we wanted. If anyone is still working at that point, they’re working as a form of expressing their creativity. They’re working because it’s in them to contribute, and to build and design things.

I don’t think capitalism is evil. Capitalism is actually good. It’s just that it gets hijacked. It gets hijacked by improper pricing of externalities. It gets hijacked by improper yields, where you have corruption, or you have monopolies.

3. Free Markets Are Intrinsic to Humans

We’re the only animals who cooperate across genetic boundaries, because we can track credits and debits in voluntary exchanges.

Free markets are intrinsic to the human species

Naval: Overall capitalism [meaning free markets] is intrinsic to the human species. Capitalism is not something we invented. Capitalism is not even something we discovered. It is in us in every exchange that we have.

When you and I exchange information, I want some information back from you. I give you information. You give me information. If we weren’t having a good information exchange, you’d go talk to somebody else. So, the notion of exchange, and keeping track of credits and debits, this is built into us as flexible social animals.

We are the only animals in the animal kingdom that cooperate across genetic boundaries. Most animals don’t even cooperate. But when they do, they cooperate only in packs where they co-evolve together, and they share blood, so they have some shared interests.

Humans don’t have that. I can cooperate with you guys. One of you is a Serbian. The other one is a Persian by origin. And I’m Indian by origin. We have very little blood in common, basically none. But we still cooperate.

What lets us cooperate? It’s because we can keep track of debits and credits. Who put in how much work? Who contributed how much? That’s all free market capitalism is.

So, I strongly believe that it is innate to the human species, and we are going to create more and more wealth, and abundance for everybody.

Everybody can be wealthy. Everybody can be retired. Everybody can be successful. It is merely a question of education and desire. You have to want it. If you don’t want it, that’s fine. Then you opt out of the game.

But don’t try to put down the people who are playing the game. Because that’s the game that keeps you in a comfortable warm bed at night. That’s the game that keeps a roof over your head. That’s the game that keeps your supermarkets stocked. That’s the game that keeps the iPhone buzzing in your pocket.

So, it is a beautiful game that is worth playing ethically, rationally, morally, socially for the human race. It’s going to continue to make us all richer and richer, until we have massive wealth creation for anybody who wants it.

Too many takers and not enough makers will plunge a society into ruin

Nivi: It’s not just individuals secretly despising wealth, right? There are countries, groups, political parties that overtly despise wealth. Or at least seem to.

Naval: That’s right. What those countries, political parties, and groups are reduced to is playing the zero-sum game of status. In the process to destroy wealth creation, they drag everybody down to their level.

Which is why the U.S. is a very popular country for immigrants because of the American dream. Anyone can come here, be poor, and then work really hard and make money, and get wealthy. But even just make some basic money for their life.

Obviously, the definition of wealth is different for different people. A First World citizen’s definition of wealth might be, “Oh, I have to make millions of dollars, and I’m completely done.”

Whereas to a Third World poor immigrant just entering the country, and we were poor immigrants who came here when I as fairly young, to the United States, wealth may just be a much lower number. It may just be, “I don’t have to work a manual labor job for the rest of my life that I don’t want to work.”

But groups that despise it will essentially bring the entire group to that level. If you get too many takers, and not enough makers, society falls apart. You end up with a communist country.

Look at Venezuela, right? They were so busy taking, and dividing, and reallocating, that people are literally starving in the streets, and losing kilograms of body weight every year just from sheer starvation.

Another way to think about it is imagine an organism that has too many parasites. You need some small number of parasites to stay healthy.

You need a lot of symbiotes. All the mitochondria in all of our cells that help us respirate and burn oxygen. These are symbiotes that help us survive. We couldn’t survive without them.

But, to me, those are partners in the wealth creation that creates the human body. But if you just were filled with parasites, if you got infected with worms, or a virus, or bacteria that were purely parasitical, you would die. So, any organism can only withstand a small number of parasites. When the parasitic element gets too far out of control, you die.

Again I’m talking about ethical wealth creation. I’m not talking about monopolies. I’m not talking about crony capitalism. I’m not talking about mispriced externalities like the environment.

I’m talking about free minds, and free markets. Small-scale exchange between humans that’s voluntary, and doesn’t have an outsized impact on others.

I think that kind of wealth creation, if a society does not respect it, if the group does not respect it, then society will plunge into ruin, and darkness.

4. Making Money Isn’t About Luck

Making money isn’t about luck. It’s about becoming the kind of person who makes money.

Making money isn’t about luck

Naval: Obviously, we want to be wealthy, and we want to get there in this lifetime without having to rely on luck.

A lot of people think making money is about luck. It’s not. It’s about becoming the kind of person that makes money.

I like to think that if I lost all my money and if you drop me on a random street in any English-speaking country, within 5, 10 years I’d be wealthy again. Because it’s a skill set that I’ve developed and I think anyone can develop.

In 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them. You don’t want to be wealthy in the 50 of them where you got lucky. We want to factor luck out of it.

There’s four kinds of luck that we’re talking about. This came from a book. Pmarca, Marc Andreessen, wrote a blog post about it.

1. Blind luck

The first kind of luck you might say is blind luck. Where I just got lucky because something completely out of my control happened. That’s fortune, that’s fate.

2. Luck from hustling

Then there’s luck that comes through persistence, hard work, hustle, motion. Which is when you’re running around creating lots of opportunities, you’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot of things, lots of things will get stirred up in the dust.

It’s almost like mixing a petri dish and seeing what combines. Or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re generating enough force and hustle and energy that luck will find you.

We, as a group, you could argue, got together because of that. Nenad had put up these great videos online, I saw them on Twitter. In that sense, he generated his own luck by creating videos until people like me keep finding him.

3. Luck from preparation

A third way is that you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in that field. When other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So you become sensitive to luck and that’s through skill and knowledge and work.

4. Luck from your unique character

Then the last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind. But that’s what we want to talk about. Which is where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, where then luck finds you.

For example, let’s say that you’re the best person in the world at deep sea underwater diving. You’re known to take on deep sea underwater dives that nobody else will even attempt to dare.

Then, by sheer luck, somebody finds a sunken treasure ship off the coast. They can’t get it. Well, their luck just became your luck, because they’re going to come to you to get that treasure. You’re going to get paid for it. 

Now, that’s an extreme example. The person who got lucky by finding the treasure chest, that was blind luck. But them coming to you and asking you to extract it and having to give you half, that’s not luck.

You created your own luck. You put yourself in a position to be able to capitalize on that luck. Or to attract that luck when nobody else has created that opportunity for themselves. When we talk about “without getting lucky,” we want to be deterministic, we don’t want to leave it to chance.

In 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them

Nivi: Do you want to elaborate a little bit more on the idea that in a 1,000 parallel universes you want to get rich in 999 of them? I think some people are going to see that and say, “that sounds impossible, it sounds like it’s too good to be true.”

Naval: No, I don’t think it’s impossible. I think that you may have to work a little bit harder at it given your starting circumstances. I started as a poor kid in India, so if I can make it, anybody can, in that sense.

Now, obviously, I had all my limbs and I had my mental faculties and I did have an education. There are some prerequisites you can’t get past. But if you’re listening to this video or podcast, you probably have the requisite means at your disposal, which is a functioning body and a functioning mind.

And I’ve encountered plenty of bad luck along the way. The first little fortune that I made, I instantly lost in the stock market. The second little fortune that I made, or I should have made, I basically got cheated by my business partners. It’s only the third time around has been a charm.

And, even then, it has been in a slow and steady struggle. I haven’t made money in my life in one giant payout. It’s always been a whole bunch of small things piling up. It’s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, including opportunities and creating investments. It hasn’t been a giant one-off thing.

Wealth stacks up one chip at a time, not all at once

My personal wealth has not been generated by one big year. It stacks up little bit, chips at a time. More options, more businesses, more investments, more things that I can do.

Same way that someone like Nenad, illacertus, he’s building his brand online. He’s building videos. It’s not like any one video is going to suddenly shower him with riches overnight. It’s going to be a long lifetime of learning, of reading, of creating that’s going to compound.

We’re talking about getting wealthy so you can retire, so you have your freedom. Not retire in the sense that you don’t do anything. But in the sense that you don’t have to be any place you don’t want to be, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, you can wake up when you want, you can sleep when you want, you don’t have a boss. That’s freedom.

We’re talking about enough wealth to get to freedom. Especially thanks to the Internet these days, though, opportunities are massively abundant. I, in fact, have too many ways to make money, I don’t have enough time. I have opportunities pouring out of my ears and the thing I keep running out of is time.

There’s just so many ways to create wealth, to create products, to create businesses, to create opportunities, and to, as a byproduct, get paid by society that I can’t even handle it all.

5. Make Luck Your Destiny

Build your character in a way so luck becomes deterministic.

Nivi: I think it’s pretty interesting that the first three kinds of luck that you described there are very common cliches for them that everybody knows. And then for that last kind of luck that comes to you out of the unique way that you act, there’s no real cliche for it.

So, for the first three kinds, there’s “dumb luck,” or “blind luck.” That’s the first kind of luck. The second kind of luck there’s the cliché that “fortune favors the bold.” That’s a person who gets lucky just by stirring the pot and acting. The third kind of luck, people say that “chance favors the prepared mind.”

But for the fourth kind of luck, there isn’t a common cliché out there that matches the unique character of your action, which I think is interesting and perhaps an opportunity and it also shows that people aren’t necessarily taking advantage of that kind of luck the way they should be.

Naval: I think also at that point, it starts becoming so deterministic that it stops being luck. So, the definition starts fading from luck to more destiny. So, I would characterize that fourth one as you build your character in a certain way and then your character becomes your destiny.

Build your character so opportunity finds you

One of the things I think that is important to making money, when you want the kind of reputation that makes people do deals through you. I use the example of like, if you’re a great diver then treasure hunters will come and give you a piece of the treasure for your diving skills.

If you’re a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term thinking deal maker, then when other people want to do deals but they don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal or offer you a unique deal just because of the integrity and reputation that you have built up.

Warren Buffett, he gets offered deals, and he gets to buy companies, and he gets to buy warrants, and bailout banks and do things that other people can’t do because of his reputation.

But of course that’s fragile. It has accountability on the line, it has a strong brand on the line, and as we will talk about later, that comes with accountability attached.

But I would say your character, your reputation, these are things that you can build that then will let you take up advantage of opportunities that other people may characterize as lucky but you know that it wasn’t luck.

Nivi: You said that this fourth kind of luck is more or less a destiny. There’s a quote from that original book that was in Marc’s blog posts from Benjamin Disraeli, who I think was the former prime minister of the UK. The quote to describe this kind of luck was, “we make our fortunes and we call them fate.”

You have to be a little eccentric to be out on the frontier by yourself

There were a couple other interesting things about this kind of luck that were mentioned in the blog post, I think it’ll be good for the listeners to hear about is that, this fourth kind of luck can almost come out of eccentric ways that you do your things and that eccentricity is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. In fact, it’s a good thing.

Naval: Yeah, absolutely. Because the world is a very efficient place, so, everyone has dug through all the obvious places to dig and so to find something that’s new and novel and uncovered, it helps to be operating on a frontier.

Where right there you have to be a little eccentric to be out on the frontier by yourself, and then you have to be willing to dig deeper than other people do, deeper than seems rational just because you’re interested.

Nivi: Yeah, the two quotes that I’ve seen that express this kind of luck in addition to that Benjamin Disraeli one, are this one from Sam Altman where he said, “extreme people get extreme results.” I think that’s pretty nice. And then there’s this other one from Jeffrey Pfeffer, who is a professor at Stanford that, “you can’t be normal and expect abnormal returns.” I’ve always enjoyed that one too.

Naval: Yeah. And one quote that I like which is the exact opposite of that is, “play stupid games win stupid prizes.” A lot of people spend a lot of their time playing social games like on Twitter where you’re trying to improve your social standing and you basically win stupid social prizes which are worthless.

Nivi: I guess the last thing that I have from this blog post is the idea that by pursuing these kinds of luck especially the last one, basically everything but dumb luck, by pursuing them you essentially run out of unluck. So, if you just keep stirring the pot and stirring the pot, that alone you will run out of unluck.

Naval: Yeah, or it could just be reversion to the mean. So, then you at least neutralized luck so that it’s your own talents that come into play.

6. You Won’t Get Rich Renting Out Your Time

You won’t get rich renting out your time, because you can’t earn non-linearly.

You won’t get rich renting out your time

Nivi: Next you go into more specific details on how you can actually get rich, and how you can’t get rich. The first point was about how you’re not going to get rich: “You are not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity, a piece of the business to gain your financial freedom.”

Naval: This is probably one of the absolute most important points. People seem to think that you can create wealth, and make money through work. And it’s probably not going to work. There are many reasons for that.

But the most basic is just that your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even at one that’s paying a lot per hour like a lawyer, or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.

So, what that means is when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. When you’re retired, you’re not earning. When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. And you can’t earn non-linearly.

If you look at even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it’s because they open a business. They open like a private practice. And that private practice builds a brand, and that brand attracts people. Or they build some kind of a medical device, or a procedure, or a process with an intellectual property.

So, essentially you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk, and has the accountability, and the intellectual property, and the brand. So, they’re just not gonna pay you enough. They’re gonna pay you the bare minimum that they have to, to get you to do their job. And that can be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not gonna be true wealth where you’re retired.

Renting out your time means you’re essentially replaceable

And then finally you’re actually just not even creating that much original for society. Like I said, this tweetstorm should have been called “How to Create Wealth.” It’s just “How to Get Rich” was a more catchy title. But you’re not creating new things for society. You’re just doing things over and over.

And you’re essentially replaceable because you’re now doing a set role. Most set roles can be taught. If they can be taught like in a school, then eventually you’re gonna be competing with someone who’s got more recent knowledge, who’s been taught, and is coming in to replace you.

You’re much more likely to be doing a job that can be eventually replaced by a robot, or by an AI. And it doesn’t even have to be wholesale replaced over night. It can be replaced a little bit at a time. And that kind of eats into your wealth creation, and therefore your earning capability.

So, fundamentally your inputs are matched to your outputs. You are replaceable, and you’re not being creative. I just don’t think that, that is a way that you can truly make money.

You must own equity to gain your financial freedom

So everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, or a business, or some kind of IP. That can be through stock options, so you can be working at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.

But usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors. They’re in an investment firm, and they’re buying equity. These are much more the routes to wealth. It doesn’t come through the hours.

You want a career where your inputs don’t match your outputs

You really just want a job, or a career, or a profession where your input is don’t match your outputs. If you look at modern society, again this is later in the tweetstorm. Businesses that have high creativity and high leverage tends to be ones where you could do an hour of work, and it can have a huge effect. Or you can do 1,000 hours of work, and it can have no effect.

For example, look at software engineering. One great engineer can for example create bitcoin, and create billions of dollars worth of value. And an engineer who is working on the wrong thing, or not quite as good, or just not as creative, or thoughtful, or whatever, can work for an entire a year, and every piece of code they ship ends up not getting used. Customers don’t want it.

That is an example of a profession where the input and the outputs are highly disconnected. It’s not based on the number of hours that you put in.

Whereas on the extreme other end, if you’re a lumberjack, even the best lumberjack in the world, assuming you’re not working with tools, so the inputs and outputs are clearly connected. You’re just using an ax, or a saw. You know, the best lumberjack in the world may be like 3x better than one of the worst lumberjacks, right? It’s not gonna be a gigantic difference.

So, you want to look for professions and careers where the inputs and outputs are highly disconnected. This is another way of saying that you want to look for things that are leveraged. And by leveraged I don’t mean financial leveraged alone, like Wall Street uses, and that has a bad name. I’m just talking about tools. We’re using tools.

Computer is a tool that software engineers use. If I’m a lumberjack with bulldozers, and automatic robot axes, and saws, I’m gonna be using tools, and have more leverage than someone who is just using his bare hands, and trying to rip the trees out by the roots.

Tools and leverage are what create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. Creativity, so the higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs.

So, I think that if you’re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it’s gonna very, very, hard to create wealth, and make wealth for yourself in that process.

7. Live Below Your Means for Freedom

People living far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t fathom.

People living below their means have freedom

Nivi: Any other big things you should avoid, other than renting out your time?

Naval: Yeah, there are two tweets that I put out that are related. The first one I was talking about where someone, like, how your lifestyle has to upgrade, shouldn’t get upgraded too fast. And that one basically said, people who are living far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t fathom.

And I think that’s very important, just to not upgrade your lifestyle all the time. To maintain your freedom. And it just gives you freedom of operation. You basically, once you make a little bit of money, you still want to be living like your old self, so that just the worry goes away. So, don’t run out to upgrade that house, and lifestyle, and all that stuff.

The most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary

Let’s say you’re getting paid $1,000 an hour. The problem is, is that when you go into a work lifestyle like that, you don’t just suddenly go from making $20 an hour to making $1,000 an hour. That’s a progression over a long career.

And as that happens, one subtle problem is that you upgrade your lifestyle as you make more, and more money. And that upgrading of the lifestyle kind of ups what you consider to be wealth, and you stay in this wage slave trap.

So, I forget who said it, maybe it was Nassim Taleb. But he said, “The most dangerous things are heroin, and a monthly salary.” Right, because they are highly addictive. The way you want to get wealthy is you want to be poor, and working, and working, and working.

Ideally, you’ll make your money in discrete lumps

And this is for example how the tech industry works. Where you don’t make any money for ten years, and then suddenly at year eleven, you might have a giant payday.

Which is by the way one reason why these very high marginal tax rates for the so-called wealthy are flawed because the highest risk-taking, most creative professions you literally lose money for a decade over your life, while you take massive risk, and you bleed, and bleed, and bleed.

And then suddenly in year eleven, or year fifteen, you might have one single big payday. But then of course Uncle Sam show up, and basically say, “Hey, you know what, you just made a lot money this year. Therefore, you’re rich. Therefore, you’re evil and you’ve got to hand it all over to us.” So, it just destroys those kinds of creative risk taking professions.

But ideally you want to make your money in discrete lumps, separated over long periods of time, so that your own lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly, and then you basically say, “Okay, now I’m done. Now I’m retired. Now I’m free. I’m still gonna work because you got to do something with your life, but I’m gonna work on only the things that I want, when I want.” And so you have much more creative expression, and much less about money.

8. Give Society What It Doesn’t Know How to Get

Society will pay you for creating what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get, and delivering it at scale.

Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get—at scale

Nivi: You’re not gonna get rich renting out your time. But you say that, “you will get rich by giving society what it wants, but does not yet know how to get at scale.”

Naval: That’s right. So, essentially as we talked about before, money is IOUs from society saying, “You did something good in the past. Now here’s something that we owe you for the future.” And so society will pay you for creating things that it wants.

But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out big time.

Almost everything that’s in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology, that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology, that made Henry Ford rich.

So, technology is just the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don’t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. So, society always wants new things.

Figure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it

And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society, that it does not yet know how to get, but it will want, that’s natural to you, and within your skillset, within your capabilities.

And then you have to figure out how to scale it. Because if you just build one of it, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them. So, everybody can have one.

Steve Jobs, and his team of course figured out that society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times 100, and be easy to use. So, they figured out how to build that, and then they figured out how to scale it.

And they figured out how to get one into every First World citizen’s pocket, and eventually every Third World citizen too. And so because of that they’re handsomely rewarded, and Apple is the most valuable company in the world.

Nivi: The way I tried to put it was that the entrepreneur’s job is to try to bring the high end to the mass market.

Naval: It starts as high end. First it starts as an act of creativity. First you create it just because you want it. You want it, and you know how to build it, and you need it. And so you build it for yourself. Then you figure out how to get it to other people. And then for a little while rich people have it.

Like, for example rich people had chauffeurs, and then they had black town cars. And then Uber came along, and everyone’s private driver is available to everybody. And now you can even see Uber pools that are replacing shuttle buses because it’s more convenient. And then you get scooters, which are even further down market of that. So, you’re right. It’s about distributing what rich people used to have to everybody.

But the entrepreneur’s job starts even before that, which is creation. Entrepreneurship is essentially an act of creating something new from scratch. Predicting that society will want it, and then figuring out how to scale it, and get it to everybody in a profitable way, in a self-sustaining way.

9. The Internet Has Massively Broadened Career Possibilities

The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers, by allowing you to scale any niche obsession.

The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers

Nivi: Let’s look at this next tweet, which I thought was cryptic, and also super interesting, about the kind of job or career that you might have. You said, “The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.”

Naval: The fundamental property of the internet more than any other single thing is it connects every human to each other human on the planet. You can now reach everyone.

Whether it’s by emailing them personally, whether it’s by broadcasting to them on Twitter, whether it’s by posting something on Facebook that they find, whether it’s by putting up a website they come and access.

It connects everyone to everyone. So, the internet is an inter-networking tool. It connects everybody. That is its superpower. So, you want to use that.

What that helps you figure out is the internet means you can find your audience for your product, or your talent, and skill no matter how far away they are.

For example, Nenad, who is Illacertus, if you look at his videos pre-internet, how would he get the message out there? It would just be … what would he do? He would run around where he lives in his neighborhood showing it to people on a computer, or a screen? Or he would try to get it played at his local movie theater? It was impossible. It only works because he can put it on the internet.

And then how many people in the world are really interested in it? Or even in interested in what we’re talking about are really gonna absorb it, right? It’s gonna be a very small subset of humanity. The key is being able to reach them.

The Internet allows you to scale any niche obsession

So, what the internet does is allows any niche obsession, which could be just the weirdest thing. It could be like people who collect snakes, to like people who like to ride hot air balloons, to people who like to sail around the world by themselves, just one person on a craft, or someone who’s obsessed with miniature cooking. Like, there’s this whole Japanese miniature cooking phenomenon. Or there’s a show about a woman who goes in people’s houses, and tidies it up, right?

So, whatever niche obsession you have, the internet allows you to scale. Now that’s not to say that what you build will be the next Facebook, or reach billions of users, but if you just want to reach 50,000 passionate people like you, there’s an audience out there for you.

So the beauty of this is that we have 7 billion human beings on the planet. The combinatorics of human DNA are incredible. Everyone is completely different. You’ll never meet any two people who are even vaguely similar to each other, that can substitute for each other.

It’s not like you can say, “Well, Nivi, just left my life. So, I can have this other person come in, and he’s just like Nivi. And I get the same feelings, and the same responses, and the same ideas.” No. There are no substitutes for people. People are completely unique.

So, given that each person has different skillsets, different interests, different obsessions. And it’s that diversity that becomes a creative superpower. So, each person can be creatively superb at their own unique thing.

But before that didn’t matter. Because if you were living in a little fishing village in Italy, like your fishing village didn’t necessarily need your completely unique skill, and you had to conform to just the few jobs that were available. But now today you can be completely unique.

You can go out on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet.

The space of careers has been so broadened. E-sports players, you know, people making millions of dollars playing Fortnite. People creating videos, and uploading them. YouTube broadcasters. Bloggers, podcasters. Joe Rogan, I read, true or false, I don’t know, but I read that he’s gonna make about $100 million a year on his podcast. And he’s had 2 billion downloads.

Even PewDiePie… there’s a hilarious tweet that I retweeted the other day. PewDiePie is the number one trusted name in news. This is a kid I think in Sweden, and he’s got three times the distribution of the top cable news networks. Just on his news channel. It’s not even on his entertainment channel.

Escape competition through authenticity

The internet enables any niche interest, as long as you’re the best at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something. Being themselves.

Another tweet I had that is worth kind of weaving in, but didn’t go into this tweetstorm, was a very simple one. I like things when I can compress them down because they’re easy to remember, and easy to hook onto. But that one was, “Escape competition through authenticity.”

Basically, when you’re competing with people it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy.

I know we’re mimetic creatures, and René Girard has a whole mimesis theory. But it’s much easier than that. Don’t imitate. Don’t copy. Just do your own thing. No one can compete with you on being you. It’s that simple.

And so the more authentic you are to who you are, and what you love to do, the less competition you’re gonna have. So, you can escape competition through authenticity when you realize that no one can compete with you on being you. And normally that would have been useless advice pre-internet. Post-internet you can turn that into a career.

10. Play Long-term Games With Long-term People

Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people. All returns in life come from compound interest over many turns of the game.

Play long-term games with long-term people

Nivi: Talk a little bit about what industries you should think about working in. What kind of job you should have? And who you might want to work with? So, you said, “One should pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.” Why?

Naval: Yeah, this is an insight into what makes Silicon Valley work, and what makes high trust societies work. Essentially, all the benefits in life come from compound interests. Whether it’s in relationships, or making money, or in learning.

So, compound interest is a marvelous force, where if you start out with 1x what you have, and then if you increase 20% a year for 30 years, it’s not that you got 30 years times 20% added on. It was compounding, so it just grew, and grew, and grew until you suddenly got a massive amount of whatever it is. Whether it’s goodwill, or love, or relationships, or money. So, I think compound interest is a very important force.

You have to be able to play a long-term game. And long-term games are good not just for compound interest, they’re also good for trust. If you look at prisoner’s dilemma type games, a solution to prisoner’s dilemma is tit-for-tat, which is I’m just going do to you what you did last time to me, with some forgiveness in case there was a mistake made. But that only works in an iterated prisoner’s dilemma, in another words if we play a game multiple times.

So, if you’re in a situation, like for example you’re in Silicon Valley, where people are doing business with each other, and they know each other, they trust each other. Then they do right by each other because they know this person will be around for the next game.

Now of course that doesn’t always work because you can make so much money in one move in Silicon Valley, sometimes people betray each other because they’re just like, “I’m going to get rich enough off this that I don’t care.” So, there can be exceptions to all these circumstances.

But essentially if you want to be successful, you have to work with other people. And you have to figure out who can you trust, and who can you trust over a long, long period of time, that you can just keep playing the game with them, so that compound interest, and high trust will make it easier to play the game, and will let you collect the major rewards, which are usually at the end of the cycle.

So, for example, Warren Buffett has done really well as an investor in the U.S. stock market, but the biggest reason he could do that was because the U.S. stock market has been stable, and around, and didn’t get for example seized by the government during a bad administration. Or the U.S. didn’t plunge into some war. The underlying platform didn’t get destroyed. So, in his case, he was playing a longterm game. And the trust came from the U.S. stock market’s stability.

When you switch industries, you’re starting over from scratch

In Silicon Valley, the trust comes from the network of people in the small geographic area, that you figure out over time who you can work with, and who you can’t.

If you keep switching locations, you keep switching groups… let’s say you started out in the woodworking industry, and you built up a network there. And you’re working hard, you’re trying to build a product in the woodworking industry. And then suddenly another industry comes along that’s adjacent but different, but you don’t really know anybody in it, and you want to dive in, and make money there.

If you keep hopping from industry to … “No, actually I need to open a line of electric car stations for electric car refueling.” That might make sense. That might be the best opportunity. But every time you reset, every time you wander out of where you built your network, you’re going to be starting from scratch. You’re not going to know who to trust. They’re not going to know to trust you.

There are also industries in which people are transient by definition. They’re always coming in and going out. Politics is an example of that, right? In politics new people are being elected. You see in politics that when you have a lot of old-timers, like the Senate, people who have been around for a long time, and they’ve been career politicians.

There’s a lot of downside to career politicians like corruption. But an upside is they actually get deals done with each other because they know the other person is going to be in the same position ten years from now, and they’re going to have to keep dealing with them, so they might as well learn how to cooperate.

Whereas every time you get a new incoming freshman class in the House of Representatives, which turns over every two years with a big wave election. Nothing gets done because of a lot fighting. “Because I just got here, I don’t know you, I don’t know if you’re going to be around, why should I work with you rather than just try to do whatever I think is right?”

So, it’s important to pick an industry where you can play long-term games, and with long-term people. So, those people have to signal that they’re going to be around for a long time. That they’re ethical. And their ethics are visible through their actions.

Long-term players make each other rich

Nivi: In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich.

Naval: I think that is a brilliant formulation. In a longterm game, it’s positive sum. We’re all baking the pie together. We’re trying to make it as big as possible. And in a short term game, we’re cutting up the pie.

Now this is not to excuse the socialists, right? The socialists are the people who are not involved in baking the pie, who show up at the end, and say, “I want a slice, or I want the whole pie.” They show up with the guns.

But I think a good leader doesn’t take credit. A good leader basically tries to inspire people, so the team gets the job done. And then things get divided up according to fairness, and who contributed how much, or as close to it as possible, and took a risk, as opposed to just whoever has the longest knife… the sharpest knife at the end.

Returns come from compound interest in iterated games

Nivi: So, these next two tweets are, “Play iterated games. All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge come from compound interest.”

Naval: When you have been doing business with somebody, you’ve been friends with somebody for ten years, twenty years, thirty years, it just gets better and better because you trust them so easily. The friction goes down, you can do bigger, and bigger things together.

For example, the simplest one is getting married to someone, and having kids, and raising children. That’s compound interest, right? Investing in those relationships. Those relationships end up being invaluable compared to more casual relationships.

It’s true in health and fitness. You know, the fitter you are, the easier it is to stay fit. Whereas the more you deteriorate your body, the harder it is to come back, and claw your way back to a baseline. It requires heroic acts.

Nivi: Regarding compound interest, I think I saw retweet something a while back. Maybe it was from Ed Latimore. It went something along the lines of, “Get some traction. Get purchase, and don’t lose it” [correction: the tweet is by @mmay3r]. So, the idea was to gain some initial traction, and never fall back, just keep ratcheting up, and up.

Naval: I don’t remember it exactly. But I think that was right. Yes, it was like, “Get traction, and don’t let go.” It was a good one, yes.

11. Pick Partners With Intelligence, Energy and Integrity

Picking partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity is the three-part checklist that you can’t compromise on.

Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity

Naval: In terms of picking people to work with, pick ones that have high intelligence, high energy, and high integrity, I find that’s the three-part checklist that you cannot compromise on.

You need someone who is smart, or they’ll head in the wrong direction. And you’re not going to end up in the right place. You need someone high-energy because the world is full of smart, lazy people.

We all know people in our life who are really smart, but can’t get out of bed, or lift a finger. And we also know people who are very high energy, but not that smart. So, they work hard, but they’re sort of running in the wrong direction.

And smart is not a pejorative. It’s not meant to say someone is smart, someone else is stupid. But it’s more that everyone is smart at different things. So, depending on what you want to do well, you have to find someone who is smart at that thing.

And then energy, a lot of times people are unmotivated for a specific thing, but they’re motivated for other things. So, for example, someone might be really unmotivated to go to a job, and sit in an office. But they might be really motivated to go paint, right?

Well, in that case they should be a painter. They should be putting art up on the internet. Trying to figure out how to build a career out of that, rather than wearing a collar around their neck, and going to a dreary job.

And then high integrity is the most important because otherwise if you’ve got the other two, what you have is you have a smart and hard working crook, who’s eventually going to cheat you. So, you have to figure out if the person is high-integrity.

And as we talked about, the way you do that is through signals. And signals is what they do, not what they say. It’s all the non-verbal stuff that they do when they think nobody is looking.

Motivation has to come intrinsically

Nivi: With respect to the energy, there was this interesting thing from Sam Altman a while back, where he was talking about delegation, and he was saying, “One of the important things for delegation is, delegate to people who are actually good at the thing that you want them to do.”

It’s the most obvious thing, but it seems like… you want to partner with people who are naturally going to do the things that you want them to do.

Naval: Yeah. I almost won’t start a company, or hire a person, or work with somebody if I just don’t think they’re into what I want them to do.

When I was younger, I used to try and talk people into things. I had this idea that you could sell someone into doing something. But you can’t. You can’t keep them motivated. You can get them inspired initially. It might work if you’re a king like Henry V, and you’re trying to get them to just charge into battle, and then they’ll figure it out.

But if you’re trying to keep someone motivated for the long-term, that motivation has to come intrinsically. You can’t just create it, nor can you be the crutch for them if they don’t have that intrinsic motivation. So, you have to make sure people actually are high-energy, and want to do what you want them to do, and what you want to work with them on.

Integrity is what someone does, despite what they say they do

Reading signals is very, very important. Signals are what people do despite what they say. So, it’s important to pay attention to subtle signals. We all know that socially if someone treats a waiter, or waitress in a restaurant really badly, then it’s only a matter of time until they treat you badly.

If somebody screws over an enemy, and is vindictive towards them, well it’s only a matter of time before they redefine you from friend to enemy, and you feel their wrath. So, angry, outraged, vindictive, short-term thinking people are essentially that way in many interactions in real life.

People are oddly consistent. That’s one of the things you learn about them. So, you want to find long-term people. You want to find people who seem irrationally ethical.

For example, I had a friend of mine whose company I invested in, and the company failed, and he could have wiped out all of the investors. But he kept putting more and more personal money in. Through three different pivots he put personal money in until the company finally succeeded. And in the process, he never wiped out the investors.

And I was always grateful to him for that. I said, “Wow, that’s amazing that you were so good to your investors. You didn’t wipe them out.” And he got offended by that. He said, “I didn’t do it for you. I didn’t do it for my investors. I did it for me. It’s my own self-esteem. It’s what I care about. That’s how I life my life.” That’s the kind of person you want to work with.

Another quote that I like, I have a tweet on this. I think I read this somewhere else, so I’m not taking credit for this. But I kind of modified it a little bit. Which is that “self-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.” You’ll always know.

So, good people, moral people, ethical people, easy to work with people, reliable people, tend to have very high self-esteem because they have very good reputations with themselves, and they understand that.

It’s not ego. Self-esteem and ego are different things. Because ego can be undeserved, but self-esteem at least you feel like you lived up to your own internal moral code of ethics.

And so it’s very hard to work with people who end up being low integrity. And it’s hard to figure out who is high integrity and low integrity. Generally, the more someone is saying that they’re moral, ethical, and high integrity, the less likely they are to be that way.

It’s very much like status signalling. If you overtly bid for status, if you overtly talk about being high status, that is a low status move. If you openly talk about how honest, reliable, and trustworthy you are, you’re probably not that honest and trustworthy. That is a characteristic of con men.

So, yeah, pick an industry in which you can play long-term games with long-term people.

12. Partner With Rational Optimists

Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.

Don’t partner with pessimists

Nivi: Let’s do this last tweet. You said, “Don’t partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.”

Naval: Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. Rational in the sense that you have to see the world for what it really is. And yet you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.

We all know people who are consistently pessimistic, who will shoot down everything. Everyone in their life has the helpful critical guy, right? He thinks he’s being helpful, but he’s actually being critical, and he’s a downer on everything.

That person will not only never do anything great in their lives, they’ll prevent other people around them from doing something great. They think their job is to shoot holes in things. And it’s okay to shoot holes in things as long as you come up with a solution.

There’s also the classic military line, “Either lead, follow, or get out of the way.” And these people want a fourth option, where they don’t want to lead, they don’t want to follow, but they don’t want to get out of the way. They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work.

And all the really successful people I know have a very strong action bias. They just do things. The easiest way to figure out if something is viable or not is by doing it. At least do the first step, and the second step, and the third, and then decide.

So, if you want to be successful in life, creating wealth, or having good relationships, or being fit, or even being happy, you need to have an action bias towards getting what you want.

Partner with rational optimists

And you have to be optimistic about it. Not irrationally. You know, there’s nothing worse than someone who is foolhardy and chasing something that’s not worth it.

That’s why I say rational optimist. But you have to be rational. Know all the pitfalls. Know the downsides, but still keep your chin up.

You’ve got one life on this planet. Why not try to build something big? This is the beauty of Elon Musk, and why I think he inspires so many people, it’s just because he takes on really, really big audacious tasks. And he provides an example for people to think big.

And it takes a lot of work to build even small things. I don’t think the corner grocery store owner is working any less hard than Elon Musk, or pouring any less sweat and toil into it. Maybe even more.

But for whatever reason, education, circumstance, they didn’t get the chance to think as big, so the outcome is not as big. So, it’s just better to think big. Obviously, rationally, within your means, stay optimistic.

The cynics and the pessimists, what they’re really saying, it’s unfortunate, but they’re basically saying, “I’ve given up. I don’t think I can do anything. And so the world to me just looks like a world where nobody can do anything. And so why should you go do something because if you fail, then I’m right, which is great. But if you succeed, then you just make me look bad.”

We’re descended from pessimists

Nivi: Yes, it’s probably better to be an irrational optimist, then it is to be a rational cynic.

Naval: There’s a completely rational frame on why you should be an optimist. Historically, if you go back 2,000 years, 5,000 years, 10,000 years, two people are wandering through a jungle, they hear a tiger. One’s an optimist, and says, “Oh, it’s not headed our way.” The other one says, “I’m a pessimist, I’m out of here.” And the pessimist runs and survives, and the optimist gets eaten.

So, we’re descended from pessimists. We’re genetically hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is far, far safer. There are no tigers wandering around the street. It’s very unlikely that you will end up in total ruin, although you should avoid total ruin.

Much more likely that the upside is unlimited, and the downside is limited. So, adapting for modern society means overriding your pessimism, and taking slightly irrationally optimistic bets because the upside is unlimited if you start the next SpaceX, or Tesla, or Uber, you can make billions of dollars of value for society, and for yourself, and change the world.

And if you fail, what’s the big deal? You lost a few million dollars of investor money, and they’ve got plenty more, and that’s the bet they take on the chances that you will succeed.

It made sense to be pessimistic in the past. It makes sense to be optimistic today, especially if you’re educated and living in a First World country. Even a Third World country. I actually think the economic opportunities in Third World countries are much larger.

The one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin. Ruin means stay out of jail. So, don’t do anything that’s illegal. It’s never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. And stay out of total catastrophic loss. That could mean that you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous, hurt your body.

You have to watch your health. And stay out of things that can cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. So, don’t gamble everything on one go. But take rationally optimistic bets with big upside.

BOCTAOE

Nivi: I think there’s people that will try and build up your ideas, and build on your ideas, no matter how far fetched they might seem. And then there are people who list all of the obvious exceptions, no matter how obvious they are.

And fortunately in the startup world, I don’t even really get exposed to the people that are giving you the obvious exceptions, and all the reasons it’s not going to work. I barely get exposed to that anymore.

Naval: That’s what Twitter is for. Scott Adams got so annoyed by this that he came up with a phrase, an acronym, which is “but of course there are obvious exceptions”, BOCTAOE. And he used to pin that acronym at the end of his articles for a while.

But Twitter is overrun with nitpickers. Whereas exactly as you were pointing out, Silicon Valley has learned that the upside is so great that you never look down on the kid who’s wearing a hoodie and has coffee on his shoes. And just looks like a slob because you don’t know if he’s going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, or the next Reid Hoffman.

So, you’ve got to treat everybody with respect. You’ve got to look up to every possibility, and opportunity because the upside is so unlimited, and the downside is so limited in the modern world, especially with financial assets and instruments.

13. Arm Yourself With Specific Knowledge

Arm yourself with specific knowledge. It can’t be trained but it can be found by pursuing your genuine curiosity.

Arm yourself with specific knowledge

Nivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about the skills that you need, in particular specific knowledge, accountability, leverage and judgment. So, the first tweet in this area is “Arm yourself with specific knowledge accountability and leverage.” And I’ll throw in judgment as well. I don’t think you covered that in that particular tweet.

Naval: If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. And why you, that’s accountability, at scale, that’s leverage, and just you getting paid as opposed to somebody else getting paid , that’s specific knowledge.

So, specific knowledge is probably the hardest thing to get across in this whole tweetstorm, and it’s probably the thing that people get the most confused about.

The thing is that we have this idea that everything can be taught, everything can be taught in school. And it’s not true that everything can be taught. In fact, the most interesting things cannot be taught.But everything can be learned. And very often that learning either comes from some innate characteristics in your DNA, or it could be through your childhood where you learn soft skills which are very, very hard to teach later on in life, or it’s something that is brand new so nobody else knows how to do it either, or it’s true on the job training because you’re pattern matching into highly complex environments, basically building judgment in a specific domain.

Classic example is investing, but it could be in anything. It could be in judgment in running a fleet of trucks, it could be judgment in weather forecasting.

So, specific knowledge is the knowledge that you care about. Especially if you’re later in life, let’s say your post 20, 21, 22, you almost don’t get to choose which specific knowledge you have. Rather, you get to look at what you have already built by that point in time, and then you can build on top of it.

Specific knowledge can’t be trained

The first thing to notice about specific knowledge is that you can’t be trained for it. If you can be trained for it, if you can go to a class and learn specific knowledge, then somebody else can be trained for it too, and then we can mass-produce and mass-train people. Heck, we can even program computers to do it and eventually we can program robots to walk around doing it.

So, if that’s the case, then you’re extremely replaceable and all we have to pay you is the minimum wage that we have to pay you to get you to do it when there are lots of other takers who can be trained to do it. So really, your returns just devolve into your cost of training plus the return on investment on that training.

So, you really want to pick up specific knowledge, you need your schooling, you need your training to be able to capitalize on the best specific knowledge, but the part of it that you’re going to get paid for is the specific knowledge.

Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your curiosity

For example, someone who goes and gets a degree in psychology and then becomes a salesperson. Well if they were already a formidable salesperson, a high grade salesmanship to begin with, then the psychology degree is leverage, it arms them and they do much better at sales.

But if they were always an introvert never very good at sales and they’re trying to use psychology to learn sales, they’re just not going to get that great at it.

So, specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It’s not by going to school for whatever it is the hottest job, it’s not for going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.

Very often specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It’s also stuff that’s just being figured out or is really hard to figure out.

So, if you’re not 100% into it somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you. And they won’t just outperform you by a little bit, they’ll outperform you by a lot because now we’re operating the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies.

So, if you’re operating with 1,000 times leverage and somebody is right 80% of the time, and somebody else is right 90% of time, the person who’s right 90% of the time will literally get paid hundreds of times more by the market because of the leverage and because of the compounding factors and being correct. So, you really want to make sure you’re good at it so that genuine curiosity is very important.

Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you

So, very often, it’s not something you sit down and then you reason about, it’s more found by observation. You almost have to look back on your own life and see what you’re actually good at.

For example, I wanted to be a scientist and that is where a lot of my moral hierarchy comes from. I view scientists sort of at the top of the production chain for humanity. And the group of scientists who have made real breakthroughs and contributions that probably added more to human society, I think, than any single other class of human beings.

Not to take away anything from art or politics or engineering or business, but without the science we’d still be scrambling in the dirt fighting with sticks and trying to start fires.

My whole value system was built around scientists and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things, talking to people.

So, I have some sales skills, which is a form specific knowledge that I have. I have some analytical skills around how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down and that is a specific skill that I have. I also just love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.

So, there are other people to whom these things would be hard and they say like, “Well, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?” Well, if you’re not already good at it or if you’re not really into it, maybe it’s not your thing, focus on the thing that you are really into.

This is ironic, but the first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge was my mother. She did it as an aside, talking from the kitchen and she said it when I was like 15 or 16 years old. I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an astrophysicist and she said, “No, you’re going to go into business.”

I was like, “What, my mom’s telling me I’m going to be in business. I’m going to be an astrophysicist. Mom doesn’t know she’s talking about.” But mom knew exactly what she was talking about.

She’d already observed that every time we walk down the street, I would critique the local pizza parlor on why they were selling their slices a certain way with certain toppings and why their process of ordering was this way when it should have been that way.

So, she knew that I had more of a business curious mind, but then my obsession with science combined to create technology and technology businesses where I found myself.

So, very often, your specific knowledge is observed and often observed by other people who know you well and revealed in situations rather than something that you come up with.

14. Specific Knowledge Is Highly Creative or Technical

Specific knowledge tends to be creative or technical. It’s on the bleeding edge of technology, art and communication.

Specific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeships

Naval: To the extent that specific knowledge is taught, it’s on the job. It’s through apprenticeships. And that’s why the best businesses, the best careers are the apprenticeship Or self-taught careers, because those are things society still has not figured out how to train and automate yet.

The classic line here is that Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham when he got out of school. Benjamin Graham was the author of the Intelligent Investor and sort of modernized or created value investing as a discipline. And Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free.

And Graham said, “Actually, you’re overpriced, free is overpriced.” And Graham was absolutely right. When it comes to a very valuable apprenticeship like the type that Graham was going to give Buffet, Buffet should have been paying him a lot of money. That right there tells you that those are skills worth having.

Specific knowledge is often highly creative or technical

Specific knowledge also tends to be technical and creative. It’s on the bleeding edge of technology, on the bleeding edge of art, on the bleeding edge of communication.

Even today, for example, there are probably meme lords out there on the Internet who can create incredible memes that will spread the idea to millions of people. Or are very persuasive – Scott Adams is a good example of this. He is essentially becoming one of the most credible people in the world by making accurate predictions through persuasive arguments and videos.

And that is specific knowledge that he has built up over the years because he got obsessed with hypnosis when he was young, he learned how to communicate through cartooning, he embraced Periscope early, so he’s been practicing lots of conversation, he’s read all the books on the topic, he’s employed in his everyday life. If you look at his girlfriend, she’s this beautiful young Instagram model.

That is an example of someone who has built up a specific knowledge over the course of his career. It’s highly creative, it has elements of being technical in it, and it’s something that is never going to be automated.

No one’s going to take that away from him, because he’s also accountable under one brand as Scott Adams, and he’s operating with the leverage of media with Periscope and drawing Dilbert cartoons and writing books. He has massive leverage on top of that brand and he can build wealth out of it if he wanted to build additional wealth beyond what he already has.

Specific knowledge is specific to the individual and situation

Nivi: Should we be calling it unique knowledge or does specific knowledge somehow make more sense for it?

Naval: You know, I came up with this framework when I was really young. We’re talking decades and decades. It’s now probably over 30 years old. So, at the time specific knowledge stuck with me so that is how I think about it.

The reason I didn’t try and change it is because every other term that I found for it was overloaded in a different way. At least specific knowledge isn’t that used. I can kind of rebrand it.

The problem with unique knowledge is, yeah, maybe it’s unique but if I learn it from somebody else it’s longer unique, then we both know it. So, it’s not so much that it is unique, it’s that it is highly specific to the situation, it’s specific to the individual, it’s specific to the problem, and it can only be built as part of a larger obsession, interest, and time spent in that domain.

It can’t just be read straight out of a single book, nor can it be taught in a single course, nor can it be programmed into a single algorithm.

You can’t be too deliberate about assembling specific knowledge

Nivi: Speaking of Scott Adams, he’s got a blog post on how to build your career by getting in, say, the top 25 percentile at three or more things. And by doing that, you become the only person in the world who can do those three things in the 25th percentile.

So, instead of trying to be the best at one thing, you just try to be very, very good at three or more things. Is that a way of building specific knowledge?

Naval: I actually think the best way is just to follow your own obsession. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you can realize that, actually, this obsession I like and I’ll keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it.

But I think if you go around trying to build it a little too deliberately, if you become too goal-oriented on the money, then you won’t pick the right thing. You won’t actually pick the thing that you love to do, so you won’t go deep enough into it.

Scott Adams’ observation is a good one, predicated on statistics. Let’s say there’s 10,000 areas that are valuable to the human race today in terms of knowledge to have, and the number one in those 10,000 slots is taken.

Someone else is likely to be the number one in each of those 10,000, unless you happen to be one of the 10,000 most obsessed people in the world that at a given thing.

But when you start combining, well, number 3,728 with top-notch sales skills and really good writing skills and someone who understands accounting and finance really well, when the need for that intersection arrives, you’ve expanded enough from 10,000 through combinatorics to millions or tens of millions. So, it just becomes much less competitive.

Also, there’s diminishing returns. So, it’s much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something.

Build specific knowledge where you are a natural

I think it’s a very pragmatic approach. But I think it’s important that one not start assembling things too deliberately because you do want to pick things where you are a natural. Everyone is a natural at something.

We’re all familiar with that phrase, a natural. “Oh, this person is a natural at meeting men or women, this person is a natural socialite, this person is a natural programmer, this person is a natural reader.” So, whatever you are a natural at, you want to double down on that.

And then there are probably multiple things you’re natural at because personalities and humans are very complex. So, we want to be able to take the things that you are natural at and combine them so that you automatically, just through sheer interest and enjoyment, end up top 25% or top 10% or top 5% at a number of things.

15. Learn to Sell, Learn to Build

Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

Learn to sell, learn to build

Nivi: Talking about combining skills, you said that you should “learn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be unstoppable.”

Naval: This is a very broad category. It’s two broad categories. One is building the product. Which is hard, and it’s multivariate. It can include design, it can include development, it can include manufacturing, logistics, procurement, it can even be designing and operating a service. It has many, many definitions.

But in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. In our tech industry it’s the CTO, it’s the programmer, it’s the software engineer, hardware engineer. But even in the laundry business, it could be the person who’s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who’s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.

The other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. Selling doesn’t necessarily just mean selling individual customers, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It’s a broad umbrella category.

The Silicon Valley model is a builder and seller

So, generally, the Silicon Valley startup model tends to work best. It’s not the only way, but it is probably the most common way, when you have two founders, one of whom is world class at selling, and one of whom is world class at building.

Examples are, of course, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple, Gates and Allen probably had similar responsibilities early on with Microsoft, Larry and Sergey probably broke down along those lines, although it’s a little different there because that was a very technical product delivered to end users through a simple interface.

But generally, you will see this pattern repeated over and over. There’s a builder and there’s a seller. There’s a CEO and CTO combo. And venture and technology investors are almost trained to look for this combo whenever possible. It’s the magic combination.

If you can do both you will be unstoppable

The ultimate is when one individual can do both. That’s when you get true superpowers. That’s when you get people who can create entire industries.

The living example is Elon Musk. He may not necessarily be building the rockets himself, but he understands enough that he actually makes technical contributions. He understands the technology well enough that no one’s going to snow him on it, and he’s not running around making claims that he doesn’t think he can’t eventually deliver. He may be optimistic on the timelines but he thinks this is within reasonableness for delivery.

Even Steve Jobs developed enough product skills and was involved enough in the product that he also operated in both of these domains. Larry Ellison started as a programmer and I think wrote the first version of Oracle, or was actually heavily involved in it.

Marc Andreessen was also in this domain. He may not have had enough confidence in his sales skills, but he was the programmer who wrote Netscape Navigator, or a big chunk of it. So, I think the real giants in any field are the people who can both build and sell.

I’d rather teach an engineer marketing than a marketer engineering

And usually the building is a thing that a sales person can’t pick up later in life. It requires too much focused time. But a builder can pick up selling a little bit later, especially if they were already innately wired to be a good communicator. Bill Gates famously paraphrases this as, “I’d rather teach an engineer marketing, than a marketer engineering.”

I think if you start out with a building mentality and you have building skills and it’s still early enough in your life, or you have enough focused time that you think you can learn selling, and you have some natural characteristics or you’re a good salesperson, then you can double down on those.

Now, your sales skills could be in a different than traditional domain. For example, let’s say you’re a really good engineer and then people are saying, well, now you need to be good at sales, well, you may not be good at hand-to-hand sales, but you may be a really good writer.

And writing is a skill that can be learned much more easily than, say, in-person selling, and so you may just cultivate writing skills until you become a good online communicator and then use that for your sales.

On the other hand, it could just be that you’re a good builder and you’re bad at writing and you don’t like communicating to mass audiences but you’re good one-on-one, so then you might use your sales skills for recruiting or for fundraising, which are more one-on-one kinds of endeavors.

This is pointing out that if you’re at the intersection of these two, don’t despair because you’re not going to be the best technologist and you’re not going to be the best salesperson, but in a weird way, that combination, back to the Scott Adams skill stack, that combination of two skills is unstoppable.

Long term, people who understand the underlying product and how to build it and can sell it, these are catnip to investors, these people can break down walls if they have enough energy, and they can get almost anything done.

Nivi: If you could only pick one to be good at, which one would you pick?

Naval: When you’re trying to stand out from the noise building is actually better because there’re so many hustlers and sales people who have nothing to back them up. When you’re starting out, when you’re trying to be recognized, building is better.

But much later down the line building gets exhausting because it is a focus job and it’s hard to stay current because there’s always new people, new products coming up who have newer tools, and frankly more time because it’s very intense, it’s a very focused task.

So, sales skills actually scale better over time. Like for example, if you have a reputation for building a great product, that’s good, but when you ship your new product, I’m going to validate it based on the product. But if you have a reputation for being a good person to do business with and you’re persuasive and communicative then that reputation almost becomes self-fulfilling.

So, I think if you only had to pick up one, you can start with building and then transition to selling. This is a cop-out answer, but I think that is actually the right answer.

16. Read What You Love Until You Love to Read

You should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it.

Read what you love until you love to read

Nivi: Before we go and talk about accountability and leverage and judgment, you’ve got a few tweets further down the line that I would put in the category of continuous learning.

They’re essentially, “there is no skill called business. Avoid business magazines and business class, study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics and computers.”

There’s one other comment that you made in a Periscope that was, “you should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it.” And the last tweet in this category was, “reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.”

Naval: Yeah, the most important tweet on this, I don’t even have in here unfortunately, which is, the foundation of learning is reading. I don’t know a smart person who doesn’t read and read all the time.

And the problem is, what do I read? How do I read? Because for most people it’s a struggle, it’s a chore. So, the most important thing is just to learn how to educate yourself and the way to educate yourself is to develop a love for reading.

So, the tweet that is left out, the one that I was hinting at is, “read what you love until you love to read.” It’s that simple.

Everybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read because they read books that they loved. It’s a little bit of a catch-22, but you basically want to start off just reading wherever you are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit. And then eventually, you will just get bored of the simple stuff.

So you may start off reading fiction, then you might graduate to science fiction, then you may graduate to non-fiction, then you may graduate to science, or philosophy, or mathematics or whatever it is, but take your natural path and just read the things that interest you until you kind of understand them. And then you’ll naturally move to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.

Read the original scientific books in a field

Now, there is an exception to this, which is where I was hinting with what things you actually do want to learn, which is, at some point there’s too much out there to read. Even reading is full of junk.

There are actually things you can read, especially early on, that will program your brain a certain way, and then later things that you read, you will decide whether those things are true or false based on the earlier things.

So, it is important that you read foundational things. And foundational things, I would say, are the original books in a given field that are very scientific in their nature.

For example, instead of reading a business book, pick up Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. Instead of reading a book on biology or evolution that’s written today, I would pick up Darwin’s Origin of the Species. Instead of reading a book on biotech right now that may be very advanced, I would just pick up The Eighth Day of Creation by Watson and Crick. Instead of reading advanced books on what cosmology and what Neil Degrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been saying, you can pick up Richard Feynman’s Six Easy Pieces and start with basic physics.

Don’t fear any book

If you understand the basics, especially in mathematics and physics and sciences, then you will not be afraid of any book. All of us have that memory of when we were sitting in class and we’re learning mathematics, and it was all logical and all made sense until at one point the class moved too fast and we fell behind.

Then after that we were left memorizing equations, memorizing concepts without being able to derive them from first principles. And at that moment, we’re lost, because unless you’re a professional mathematician, you’re not going to remember those things. All you’re going to remember are the techniques, the foundations.

So, you have to make sure that you’re building on a steel frame of understanding because you’re putting together a foundation for skyscraper, and you’re not just memorizing things because you’re just memorizing things you’re lost. So the foundations are ultra important.

And the ultimate, the ultimate is when you walk into a library and you look at it up and down and you don’t fear any book. You know that you can take any book off the shelf, you can read it, you can understand it, you can absorb what is true, you can reject what is false, and you have a basis for even working that out that is logical and scientific and not purely just based on opinions.

The means of learning are abundant, the desire to learn is scarce

The beauty of the internet is the entire library of Alexandria times 10 is at your fingertips at all times. It’s not the means of education or the means of learning are scarce, the means of learning are abundant. It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce. So, you really have to cultivate the desire.

And it’s not even cultivating you’ve to not lose it. Children have a natural curiosity. If you go to a young child who’s first learning language, they’re pretty much always asking: What’s this? What’s that? Why is this? Who’s that? They’re always asking questions.

But one of the problems is that schools and our educational system, and even our way of raising children replaces curiosity with compliance. And once you replace the curiosity with the compliance, you get an obedient factory worker, but you no longer get a creative thinker. And you need creativity, you need the ability to feed your own brain to learn whatever you want.

17. The Foundations Are Math and Logic

If you understand mathematics and logic, you have the basis for understanding everything else.

The ultimate foundations are math and logic

Naval: Foundational things are principles, they’re algorithms, they’re deep seated logical understanding where you can defend it or attack it from any angle. And that’s why microeconomics is important because macroeconomics is a lot of memorization, a lot of macro bullshit.

As Nassim Taleb says, it is easier to macro bullshit than it is the micro bullshit. Because macroeconomics is voodoo-complex-science meets politics. You can’t find two macroeconomists to agree on anything these days, and different macroeconomists get used by different politicians to peddle their different pet theories.

There are even macroeconomists out there now peddling something called Modern Monetary Theory which basically says, hey, except for this pesky thing called inflation, we can just print all the money that we want. Yes, except for this pesky thing called inflation. That’s like saying, except for limited energy, we can fire rockets off into space all day long.

It’s just nonsense, but the fact that there are people who have “macroeconomist” in their title and are peddling Modern Monetary Theory just tells you that macroeconomics as a so-called science has been corrupted. It’s now a branch of politics.

So, you really want to focus on the foundations. The ultimate foundation are mathematics and logic. If you understand logic and mathematics, then you have the basis for understanding the scientific method. Once you understand the scientific method, then you can understand how to separate truth from falsehood in other fields and other things that you’re reading.

It’s better to read a great book really slowly than to fly through a hundred books quickly

So, be very careful about reading other people’s opinions and even be careful when reading facts because so-called facts are often just opinions with a veneer [of pseudoscience] around them.

What you are really looking for are algorithms. What you are really looking for is understanding. It’s better to go through a book really slowly and struggle and stumble and rewind, than it is to fly through it quickly and say, “Well, now I’ve read 20 books, I’ve read 30 books, I’ve read 50 books in the field.”

It’s like Bruce Lee said, “I don’t fear the man who knows a thousand kicks and a thousand punches, I fear the man who’s practiced one punch ten thousand times or one kick ten thousand times.” It’s that understanding that comes through repetition and through usage and through logic and foundations that really makes you a smart thinker.

Learn persuasion and programming

Nivi: To lay a foundation for learning for the rest of your life I think you need two things, if I was going to try and sum it up. One, practical persuasion and two, you need to go deep in some technical category, whether it’s abstract math, or you want to read Donald Knuth’s books on algorithms, or you want to read Feynman’s lectures on physics.

If you have practical persuasion and a deep understanding of some complex topic, I think you’ll have a great foundation for learning for the rest of your life.

Naval: Yeah. In fact let me expand that a little bit. I would say that the five most important skills are of course, reading, writing, arithmetic, and then as you’re adding in, persuasion, which is talking. And then finally, I would add computer programming just because it’s an applied form of arithmetic that just gets you so much leverage for free in any domain that you operate in.

If you’re good with computers, if you’re good at basic mathematics, if you’re good at writing, if you’re good at speaking, and if you like reading, you’re set for life.

18. There’s No Actual Skill Called “Business”

There’s no actual skill called business. Avoid business schools and magazines.

There’s no actual skill called “business”

Naval: In that sense, business to me is bottom of the barrel. There’s no actual skill called business, it’s too generic. It’s like a skill called “relating.” Like “relating to humans.” That’s not a skill, it’s too broad.

A lot of what goes on in business schools, and there is some very intelligent stuff taught in business schools – I don’t mean to detract from them completely – some of the things taught in business school are just anecdotes. They call them “case studies.”

But they’re just anecdotes, and they’re trying to help you pattern match by throwing lots of data points at you, but the reality is, you will never understand them fully until you’re actually in that position yourself. 

Even then you will find that basic concepts from game theory, psychology, ethics, mathematics, computers, and logic will serve you much, much better.

I would focus on the foundations, I would focus with a science bent. I would develop a love for reading, including by reading so-called junk food that you’re not supposed to read. You don’t have to read the classics. That [reading] is the foundation for your self-education.

Doing is faster than watching

Nivi: What did you mean when you said that “doing is faster than watching?”

Naval: When it comes to your learning curve, if you want to optimize your learning curve… One of the reasons why I don’t love podcasts, even though I’m a generator of podcasts, is that I like to consume my information very quickly.

And I’m a good reader, or a fast reader and I can read very fast but I can only listen at a certain speed. I know people listen at 2x, 3x, but everyone sounds like a chipmunk and it’s hard to go back, it’s hard to highlight, it’s hard to pinpoint snippets and save them in your notebook, and so on.

Similarly, a lot of people think they can become really skilled at something by watching others do it, or even by reading about others doing it. And going back to the business school case study, that’s a classic example.

They study other people’s businesses, but in reality, you’re going to learn a lot more about running a business by operating your own lemonade stand or equivalent. Or even opening a little retail store down the street.

That is how you’re going to learn on the job because a lot of the subtleties don’t express themselves until you’re actually in the business.

For example, everyone’s into mental models these days. You go to Farnam Street, you go to Poor Charlie’s Almanack, and you can learn all the different mental models. But which ones matter more? Which ones do you apply more often? Which ones matter in which circumstances? That’s actually the hard part.

For example, my personal learning has been that the principal-agent problem drives so much in this world. It’s an incentives problem. I’ve learned that tit-for-tat iterated prisoner’s dilemma is the piece of game theory that is worth knowing the most. You can almost put down the game theory book after that.

By the way, the best way to learn game theory is to play lots of games. I never even read game theory books. I consider myself extremely good at game theory. I’ve never opened up a game theory book and found a result in there where I didn’t think, “Oh, yeah, that’s common sense to me.”

The reason is that I grew up playing all kinds of games and I ran into all kinds of corner cases with all kinds of friends, and so it’s just second nature to me. You can always learn better by doing it on the job.

The number of “doing” iterations drives the learning curve

But doing is a subtle thing. Doing encapsulates a lot. For example, let’s say, I want to learn how to run a business. Well, if I start a business where I go in every day and I’m doing the same thing, let’s say I’m running a retail store down the street where I’m stocking the shelves with food and liquor every single day, I’m not going to learn that much because I’m repeating things a lot.

So, I’m putting in thousands of hours, but they are thousands of hours doing the same thing. Whereas if I was putting in thousands of iterations, that would be different. So, the learning curve is across iterations [not iterations].

So if I was trying new marketing experiments in the store all the time, I was constantly changing up the inventory, I was constantly changing up the branding and the messaging, I was constantly changing the sign, I was constantly changing the online channels that are used to drive foot traffic in, I was experimenting with being open at different hours, I had the ability to walk around and talk to other store owners and getting their books and figure out how they run their businesses.

It’s the number of iterations that drives the learning curve. So, the more iterations you can have, the more shots on goal you can have, the faster you’re going to learn. It’s not just about the hours put in.

If you’re willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later

It’s actually a combination of the two, but I think just the way we’re built and the way that the world presents itself, the world offers us very easily the opportunity to do the same thing over and over and over again. But really, we’d be better served if we went off and found ways to do new things from scratch.

And doing something new the first time is painful, because you’re wandering into uncertain territory and high odds are that you will fail. So you just have to get very, very comfortable with frequent small failures.

Nassim Taleb talks about this also. He made his fortune, his wealth by being a trader who basically relied upon black swans. Nassim Taleb made money by losing little bits of money every day and then once in a blue moon he would make a lot of money when the unthinkable happened for other people.

Whereas most people want to make little bits of money every day and in exchange they’ll tolerate lots of blow-up risk, they’ll tolerate going completely bankrupt.

We’re not evolved to bleed a little bit every day. If you’re out in the natural environment, and you get a cut and you’re literally bleeding a little bit every day, you will eventually die. You’ll have to stop that cut.

We’re evolved for small victories all the time but that becomes very expensive. That’s where the crowd is. That’s where the herd is. So, if you’re willing to bleed a little bit every day but in exchange you’ll win big later, you will do better.

That is, by the way, entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs bleed every day.

They’re not making money, they’re losing money, they’re constantly stressed out, all the responsibility is upon them, but when they win they win big. On average they’ll make more.

19. Embrace Accountability to Get Leverage

Embrace accountability. Society will reward you with leverage.

You have to have accountability to get leverage

Nivi: Why don’t we jump into accountability, which I thought was pretty interesting and I think you have your own unique take on it. So the first tweet on accountability was, “Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.”

Naval: Yeah. So to get rich, you’re going to need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money or assets to manage or machines.

So to get these things, you have to build up credibility and you have to do those under your own name as much as possible, which is risky. So accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly.

Take business risks under your own name

So in that sense, people who are stamping their names on things aren’t foolish. They’re just confident. Maybe it turns out to be foolish in the end, but if you look at a Kanye or an Oprah or a Trump or an Elon or anyone like that, these people can get rich just off their name because their name is such powerful branding.

Regardless of what you think of Trump, you have to realize that the guy was among the best in the world at just branding his name. Why would you go to Trump Casino? Used to be because Trump. Why would you go to a Trump tower? Because of Trump.

When it came time to vote, I think that a lot of voters just went in and said, “Trump.” They recognize the name, so the name recognition paid off.

Same thing with Oprah. She puts her brand on something, her name on something and it flies off the shelves, and it’s like an instant validator.

These people also take risks for putting their name out there. Obviously Trump is now probably hated by half or more than half of the country and by a big chunk of the world as he sticks his name out there.

By putting your name out there, you become a celebrity, and fame has many, many downsides. It’s better to be anonymous and rich than to be poor and famous, but even famous and rich has a lot of downsides associated with it. You’re always in the public eye.

A well-functioning team has clear accountability for each position

Accountability is quite important, and when you’re working to build a product or you’re working in a team or you’re working in a business, we constantly have drummed into our heads how important it is to be part of a team. Absolutely agree with that.

A lot of our training socially is telling us to not stick our necks out of the crowd. There’s a saying that I hear from our Australian friends that the tall poppy gets cut. Don’t stick your neck out, but I would say that actually a really, really well-functioning team is small and has clear accountability for each of the different portions.

You can say, “Okay, this person’s responsible for building the product. This person’s responsible for the messaging. This person’s responsible for raising money. This person’s responsible for the pricing strategy and maybe the online advertising.” So if somebody screws up, you know exactly who’s responsible. While at the same time if something goes really well, you also know exactly who’s responsible.

If you have a small team and you have clearly delineated responsibilities, then you can still keep a very high level of accountability. Accountability is really important because when something succeeds or fails, if it fails, everybody points fingers at each other, and if it succeeds, everybody steps forward to take credit.

We’ve all had that experience when we were in school and we got a group assignment to do. There were probably a few people in there who did a lot of the work. Then there are a few people who just did a lot of grandstanding or positioning to do the work. We’re all familiar with this from a childhood sense, but it’s sort of uncomfortable to talk about.

People who can fail in public have a lot of power

Clear accountability is important. Without accountability, you don’t have incentives. Without accountability, you can’t build credibility. But you take risk. You take risk of failure. You take risk of humiliation. You take risk of failure under your own name.

Luckily in modern society, there’s no more debtors’ prison and people don’t go to jail or get executed for losing other people’s money, but we’re still socially hard wired to not fail in public under our own names. The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power .

For example, I’ll give a personal anecdote. Up until about 2013, 2014, my public persona was an entirely around startups and investing. Only around 2014, 2015 did I start talking about philosophy and psychological things and broader things.

It made me a little nervous because I was doing it under my own name. There were definitely people in the industry who sent me messages through the back channel like, “What are you doing? You’re ending your career. This is stupid.”

I kind of just went with it. I took a risk. Same with crypto. Early on, I took a risk.

But when you put your name out there, you take a risk with certain things. You also get to reap the rewards. You get the benefits.

20. Take Accountability to Earn Equity

If you have high accountability, you’re less replaceable and you can get a piece of the business.

Accountability is how you’re going to get equity

Naval: Accountability is important because that’s how you’re going to get leverage. That’s how you’re going to get credibility. It’s also how you’re going to get equity. You’re going to get a piece of the business.

When you’re negotiating with other people, ultimately if someone else is making a decision about how to compensate you, that decision will be based on how replaceable you are. If you have high accountability, that makes you less replaceable. Then they have to give you equity, which is a piece of the upside.

Taking accountability is like taking equity in all your work

Equity itself is a good example because equity is also a risk-based instrument. Equity means you get paid everything after all the people who need guaranteed money are paid back.

If you look at the hierarchy of capital in a company, the employees get paid first. They get paid the salary first. In legal [bankruptcy] proceedings, the salaries are sacrosanct. If you’re a board member and the company spends too much money and has back salaries to pay, the government can go after you personally to pay back the salaries. The employees get the most security, but in exchange for that security, they don’t have as much upside.

Next in line would be the debt holders who are maybe the bankers who lend money to the company for operations and they need to make their fixed coupon every month or every year, but they don’t get much more upside beyond that. They might be making 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% a year, but that’s what their upside is limited to.

Finally there are the equity holders. These people are actually going to get most of the upside. Once the debt holders are paid off and the salaries are paid off, whatever remains goes to them.

But if there isn’t enough money to pay off the salaries and the debt holders, or if there’s just barely enough to pay off the salary and the debt holders, which is what happens with most businesses, most of the times, the equity holders get nothing.

The equity holders take on greater risk, but in exchange, they get nearly unlimited upside. You can do the same with all of your work. Essentially, taking accountability for your actions is the same as taking an equity position in all of your work. You’re taking greater downside risk for greater upside.

Realize that in modern society, the downside risk is not that large. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. I’m most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high integrity effort.

There’s not really that much to fear in terms of failure, and so people should be taking on a lot more accountability than they actually are.

Nivi: Is accountability actually fragile or do you really just mean that we’re hardwired not to fail in public, so it just feels like it’s a fragile thing?

Naval: I think it could actually be fragile. An example of accountability is you’re an airplane pilot. As a captain, you’re taking on accountability for the entire plane.

Let’s say that something goes wrong with the aircraft. You can’t later blame it on anyone else. You can’t blame it on the steward or the stewardess. You can’t blame it on the copilot. You’re the captain. You’re responsible for the ship. If you screw up, you crash the ship, and there are immediate consequences.

In the old days, the captain was expected to go down with the ship. If the ship was sinking, then literally the last person who got to get off was the captain. I think accountability does come with real risks, but we’re talking about a business context.

The risk here would be that you would probably be the last one to get your capital back out. You’d be the last one to get paid for your time. The time that you’ve put in, the capital that you’ve put into the company, these are what are at risk.

Even if a business fails and your name’s on it, that’s not as bad as if it turns out to be an integrity issue. Bernie Madoff, for example, Madoff investments, that name is never going to be good again in the investment community. You could be Bernie Madoff’s great-great-great-grandson. You are not going to go into the investment business because he ruined the family name.

I think these days the accountability risk with a name happens more around integrity, rather than it does around purely economic failure.

Accountability is reputational skin in the game

Nivi: The big takeaway for me on accountability is that you will be rewarded directly in proportion with your accountability. I also think this is why people like Taleb rail against CEOs who get rewards without accountability.

Naval: Yeah. Taleb’s Skin In The Game is required reading. If you want to get anywhere in modern life and understand how modern systems work, then Skin In The Game would be near the top of my list to read.

Accountability, skin in the game, these concepts go very closely hand in hand. I think of accountability as reputational skin in the game. It’s putting your personal reputation on the line as skin in the game.

Accountability is a simple concept. The only part of accountability that may be a little counterintuitive is that we’re currently socially brainwashed to not take on accountability, not in a visible way.

I think there are ways to take on accountability where every member of a team can take on accountability for their portion. That is how you get a well-functioning team while still putting credits and losses in the correct columns.

21. Labor and Capital Are Old Leverage

Wealth requires leverage. Labor and capital are older forms of leverage that everyone is fighting over.

Our brains aren’t evolved to comprehend new forms of leverage

Nivi: Why don’t we talk a little bit about leverage?

The first tweet in the storm was a famous quote from Archimedes, which was, “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I will move the Earth.”

The next tweet was, “Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal costs of replication.”

Naval: Leverage is critical. The reason I stuck in Archimedes quote in there is… normally I don’t like putting other people’s quotes in my Twitter. That doesn’t add any value. You can go look up those people’s quotes. But this quote I had to put in there because it’s just so fundamental. I read it when I was very, very young and it had a huge impression on me.

We all know what leverage is when we use a seesaw or a lever. We understand how that works physically, but I think what our brains aren’t really well-evolved to comprehend is how much leverage is possible in modern society and what the newest forms of leverage are.

Society overvalues labor leverage

The oldest form of leverage is labor, which is people working for you. Instead of me lifting rocks, I can have 10 people lift rocks. Then just by my guidance on where the rock should go, a lot more rocks get moved than I could do myself. Everybody understands this because we’re evolved to understand the labor form of leverage, so what happens is society overvalues labor as a form of leverage.

This is why your parents are impressed when you get a promotion and you have lots of people working underneath you. This is why when a lot of naive people, when you tell them about your company, they’ll say, “How many people work there?” They’ll use that as a way to establish credibility. They’re trying to measure how much leverage and impact you actually have.

Or when someone starts a movement, they’ll say how many people they have or how big the army is. We just automatically assume that more people is better.

You want the minimum amount of labor that allows you to use the other forms of leverage

I would argue that this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You’re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob.

It’s incredibly competed over. Entire civilizations have been destroyed over this fight. For example, communism, Marxism, is all about the battle between capital and labor, das kapital and das labor. It’s kind of a trap.

You really want to stay out of labor-based leverage. You want the minimum amount of people working with you that are going to allow to use the other forms of leverage, which I would argue are much more interesting.

Capital has been the dominant form of leverage in the last century

The second type of leverage is capital. This one’s a little less hardwired into us because large amounts of money moving around and being saved and being invested in money markets, these are inventions of human beings the in last few hundred to few thousand years. They’re not evolved with us from hundreds of thousands of years.

We understand them a little bit less well. They probably require more intelligence to use correctly, and the ways in which we use them keep changing. Management skills from a hundred years ago might still apply today, but investing in the stock market skills from a hundred years ago probably don’t apply to the same level today.

Capital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It’s more modern. It’s the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It’s probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century.

You can see this by who are the richest people. It’s bankers, politicians in corrupt countries who print money, essentially people who move large amounts of money around.

If you look at the top of very large companies, outside of technology companies, in many, many large old companies, the CEO job is really a financial job. They’re really financial asset managers. Sometimes, an asset manager can put a pleasant face on it, so you get a Warren Buffet type.

But deep down, I think we all dislike capital as a form of leverage because it feels unfair. It’s this invisible thing that can be accumulated and passed across generations and suddenly seems to result in people having gargantuan amounts of money with nobody else around them or necessarily sharing in it.

That said, capital is a powerful form of leverage. It can be converted to labor. It can be converted to other things. It’s very surgical, very analytical.

If you are a brilliant investor and give $1 billion and you can make a 30% return with it, whereas anybody else can only make a 20% return, you’re going to get all the money and you’re going to get paid very handsomely for it.

It scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people.

You need specific knowledge and accountability to obtain capital

It is a good form of leverage, but the hard part with capital is how do you obtain it? That’s why I talked about specific knowledge and accountability first.

If you have specific knowledge in a domain and if you’re accountable and you have a good name in that domain, then people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage that you can use to then go get more capital.

If you have specific knowledge in a domain and if you’re accountable and you have a good name in that domain, then people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage that you can use to then go get more capital.

Capital also is fairly well understood. I think a lot of the knocks against capitalism come because of the accumulation of capital.

22. Product and Media are New Leverage

Product and media are the leverage of new wealth. Create software and media that work for you while you sleep.

Product and media are the new leverage

Naval: The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is this idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage.

This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It got started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the Internet and with coding.

Now, you can multiply your efforts without having to involve other humans and without needing money from other humans.

This podcast is a form of leverage. Long ago, I would have had to sit in a lecture hall and lecture each of you personally. I would have maybe reached a few hundred people and that would have been that.

Then 40 years ago, 30 years ago, I would have to be lucky to get on TV, which is somebody else’s leverage. They would have distorted the message. They would taken the economics out of it or charged me for it. They would have muddled the message, and I would have been lucky to get that form of leverage.

Today, thanks to the Internet, I can buy a cheap microphone, hook it up to a laptop or an iPad, and there you are all listening.

Product leverage is where the new fortunes are made

This newest form of leverage is where all the new fortunes are made, all the new billionaires. The last generation, fortunes were made by capital. That was the Warren Buffets of the world.

But the new generation’s fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan making 50 to a 100 million bucks a year from his podcast. You’re going to have a PewDiePie. I don’t know how much money he’s rolling in, but he’s bigger than the news. The Fortnite players. Of course Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. That is all code-based leverage.

Combining all three forms of leverage is a magic combination

Now, the beauty is when you combine all of these three. That’s where tech startups really excel, where you take just the minimum, but highest output labor that you can get, which are engineers, and designers, product developers. Then you add in capital. You use that for marketing, advertising, scaling. You add in lots of code and media and podcasts and content to get it all out there.

That is a magic combination, and that’s why you see technology startups explode out of nowhere, use massive leverage and just make huge outsize returns.

Product and media leverage are permissionless

Nivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about permissioned versus permissionless?

Naval: Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about the new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed.

For labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.

Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing, these kinds of things, these are permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to do them, and that’s why they are very egalitarian. They’re great equalizers of leverage.

As much as people may rail on Facebook and YouTube, they’re not going to stop using it because this permissionless leverage, where everyone can be a broadcaster, is just too good.

The same way you can rail upon Apple for having a slightly closed ecosystem in the iPhone, but everyone’s writing apps for it. As long as you can write apps for it, you can get rich or reach users doing that, why not?

The robot army is already here—code lets you tell them what to do

I think of all the forms of leverage, the best one in modern society … This is glib. This is a little overused. This is why I tell people learn to code. It’s that we have this idea that in the future there’s going to be these robots and they’re going to be doing everything.

That may be true, but I would say that the majority of the robot revolution has already happened. The robots are already here and there are way more robots than there are humans, it’s just that we pack them in data centers for heat and efficiency reasons. We put them in servers. They’re inside the computers. All the circuits, it’s robot minds inside that’s doing all the work.

Every great software developer, for example, now has an army of robots working for him at nighttime, while he or she sleeps, after they’ve written the code and it’s just cranking away.

The robot army is already here. The robot revolution has already happened. We’re about halfway through it. We’re just adding in much more of the hardware component these days as we get more comfortable with the idea of autonomous vehicles and autonomous airplanes and autonomous ships and maybe autonomous trucks. There’re delivery bots and Boston Dynamics robots and all that.

But robots who are doing web searching for you, for example, are already here. The ones who are cleaning up your video and audio and transmitting it around the world are already here. The ones who are answering many customer service queries, things that you would have had to call a human for are already here.

An army of robots is already here. It’s very cheaply available. The bottleneck is just figuring out intelligent and interesting things to do to them.

Essentially you can order this army of robots around. The commands have to be issued in a computer language, in a language that they understand.

These robots aren’t very smart. They have to be told very precisely what to do and how to do it. Coding is such a great superpower because now you can speak the language of the robot armies and you can tell them what to do.

Nivi: I think at this point, people are not only commanding the army of robots within servers through code, they’re actually manipulating the movement of trucks, of other people. Just ordering a package on Amazon, you’re manipulating the movement of many people and many robots to get a package delivered to you.

People are doing the same things to build businesses now. There’s the army of robots within servers and then there’s also an army of actual robots and people that are being manipulated through software.

23. Product Leverage is Egalitarian

Labor and capital are limited to the people who control those resources. But products reach global markets.

Product leverage is a positive sum game

Naval: Labor and capital are much less egalitarian, not just in the inputs, but in their outputs.

Let’s say that I need something that humans have to provide like if I want a massage or if I need someone to cook my food. The more of a human element there is in providing that service, the less egalitarian it is. Jeff Bezos probably has much better vacations than most of us because he has lots of humans running around doing whatever he needs to do.

If you look at the output of code and media, Jeff Bezos doesn’t get to watch better movies and TV than we do. Jeff Bezos doesn’t get to even have better computing experience. Google doesn’t give him some premium, special Google account where his searches are better.

It’s the nature of code and media output that the same product is accessible to everybody. It turns into a positive sum game where if Jeff Bezos is consuming the same product as a thousand other people, that product is going to be better than the version that Jeff would consume on his own.

Status goods are limited to a few people

Whereas with other products, that’s not true. If you look at something like buying a Rolex, which is no longer about telling time. It’s a signaling good. It’s all about showing off, “I have a Rolex.” That’s a zero sum game.

If everybody in the world is wearing a Rolex, then people don’t want to wear Rolexes anymore because they no longer signal. It’s canceled out the effect.

Rich people do have an advantage in consuming that product. They’ll just price it up until only they can have Rolexes. Then poor people can’t have Rolexes and Rolexes resume their signaling value.

The best products tend to be targeted at the middle class

Something like watching Netflix or using Google or using Facebook or YouTube or even frankly modern day cars. Rich people don’t have better cars. They just have weirder cars.

You can’t drive a Lamborghini on the street at any speed that makes sense for a Lamborghini, so it’s actually a worse car in the street. It just turned into a signaling good at that point. Your sweet spot, where you want to be, is somewhere like a Tesla Model 3 or like a Toyota Corolla is an amazing car.

A new Toyota Corolla is a really nice car, but because it’s mainstream, the technology has amortized the cost of production over the largest number of consumers possible.

The best products tend to be at the center, at the sweet spot, the middle class, rather than being targeted at the upper class.

Creating wealth with product leads to more ethical wealth

I think one of the things that we don’t necessarily appreciate in modern societies is as the forms of leverage have gone from being human-based, labor-based and being capital-based to being more product and code and media-based, that most of the goods and services that we consume are becoming much more egalitarian in their consumption.

Even food is becoming that way. Food is becoming cheap and abundant, at least in the first world, too much so to our detriment. Jeff Bezos isn’t necessarily eating better food. He’s just eating different food or he’s eating food that’s prepared and served theatrically, so it’s almost like more of again the human element of performance.

But the labor element out of food production has gone down massively. The capital element has gone down massively. Even food production itself has become more technology-oriented, and so the gap between the haves and the have-nots is getting smaller.

If you care about ethics in wealth creation, it is better to create your wealth using code and media as leverage because then those products are equally available to everybody as opposed to trying to create your wealth through labor or capital.

You want to use the product that is used by the most people

What I’m referring to here is scale economies. Technology products and media products have such amazing scale economies that you always want to use the product that is used by the most people. The one that’s used by the most people ends up having the largest budget. There’s no marginal cost of adding another user, and so with the largest budget, you get the highest quality.

The best TV shows are actually not going to be some obscure ones just made for a few rich people. They’re going to be the big budget ones, like the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad or Bird Box, where they have massive, massive budgets. They can just use those budgets to get to a certain quality level.

Then rich people, to be different, they have to fly to Sundance and watch a documentary. You and I aren’t going to fly to Sundance because that’s something that bored rich people do to show off. We’re not going to watch a documentary because most of them just aren’t actually even that good.

Again, if you’re wealthy today, for large classes of things, you spend your money on signaling goods to show other people that you’re wealthy, then you try and convert them to status. As opposed to actually consuming the goods for their own sake.

Nivi: People and capital as a form of leverage have a negative externality and code and product have a positive externality attached to them, if I was going to sum up your point.

Capital and labor are becoming permissionless

I think that capital and labor are also starting to become a little more permissionless or at least the permissioning is diffuse because of the Internet. Instead of labor, we have community now, which is a diffused form of labor. For example, Mark Zuckerberg has a billion people doing work for him by using Facebook.

Instead of going to raise capital from someone who’s rich, now we have crowdfunding. You can raise millions and millions of dollars for a charity, for a health problem or for a business. You can do it all online.

Capital and labor are also becoming permissionless, and you don’t need to necessarily do it the old fashioned way, where you have to go around and ask people for permission to use their money or their time.

24. Pick a Business Model With Leverage

Ideally, you should pick a business model with network effects, low marginal costs and scale economies.

Scale economies: the more you produce, the cheaper it gets

Nivi: One more question about leverage. Do you think a choice of business model or a choice of product can also bring a kind of leverage to it?

For example, pursuing a business that has network effects. Pursuing a business that has brand effects. Or other choices of business model that people could manipulate that just give you free leverage.

Naval: Yeah, there’s some really good microeconomic concepts that are important to understand.

One of those is scale economies, which is the more you produce of something the cheaper it gets to make it. That’s something that a lot of businesses have, Basic Economics 101.

You should try and get into a business where making Widget Number 12 is cheaper than making Widget Number 5, and making Widget Number 10,000 is a lot cheaper than the previous ones. This builds up an automatic barrier to entry against competition and getting commoditized. That’s an important one.

Zero marginal cost of reproduction: producing more is free

Another one is, and this is along the same lines, but technology products especially, and media products, have this great quality where they have zero marginal cost of reproduction. Creating another copy of what you just created is free.

When somebody listens to this podcast or watches a YouTube video about this, it doesn’t cost me anything for the next person who shows up. Those zero marginal cost things, they take a while to get going because you make very little money per user, but over time they can really, really add up.

Joe Rogan is working no harder on his current podcast than he was on Podcast number 1, but on Podcast number 1,100 he’s making a million dollars from the podcast whereas for the previous one he probably lost money; for the first one. That’s an example of zero marginal cost.

Network effects: value grows as the square of the customers

Then, the most subtle but the most important is this idea of network effects. It comes from computer networking. Bob Metcalfe, who created Ethernet, famously coined Metcalfe’s Law, which is the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes in the network.

If a network of size 10 would have a value of a 100, a network of a size 100 would have a value of 10,000. It’s not just 10 times more, it’s 100 times more, because of the square; the difference is the square.

You want to be in a network effects business, assuming you’re not number two. If you’re number one in network effect business, you win everything. Example: if you look at Facebook, your friends and family social networking protocol. Who’s their competitor? Nobody, because they won everything through network effects. Which is why when people say, “Well, I can just switch away from Facebook,” they don’t realize that network effects create natural monopolies. They’re very, very powerful things.

Network effect businesses are natural monopolies

One of the dirty secrets of Silicon Valley is that a lot of the winning businesses are natural monopolies. Even ride-sharing tends towards one winner-take-all system.

Uber will always have better economics than Lyft, as long as it’s moving more drivers and more riders around. Something like Google, there’s basically only one viable search engine. I do like DuckDuckGo, privacy reasons, but they’re just always gonna be behind because of network effects. Twitter: where else would you go for microblogging? Even YouTube has weak network effects, but they’re still powerful enough that there’s really no number two site that you go to, to consume your video on a regular basis. It even turns out in e-tail, Amazon Prime and kind of the convenience of stored credit cards and information creates a powerful network effect.

In a network effect, each new user adds value to the existing users

What is a network effect? Let’s just define it precisely. A network effect is when each additional user adds value to the existing user base. Your users themselves are creating some value for the existing users.

The classic example that I think everybody can understand is, language. Let’s say that there’s 100 people living in the community and speak 10 different languages, and each person just speaks one of those 10. Well, you’re having to translate all the time; it’s incredibly painful. But if all 100 of you spoke the same language, it would add tremendous value.

The way that community will play out is, 10 people start off speaking 10 languages, and let’s say one extra person learns English. Well, now all of a sudden, 11 people know English, so the next person comes in to learn a new language is probably going to chose English. At some point, let’s say English gets to 20 or 25 people, it’s done. It’s just going to own the entire language marketplace, and the rest of the languages will get competed out.

Which is why, long-term, the entire world is probably going to end up speaking English and Chinese. China’s closed off on the Internet, but the Internet itself is a great leveler, and people who want to communicate on the Internet are forced to speak English because the largest community of people on the `Internet speaks English.

I always feel bad for my colleagues who grew up speaking foreign languages in foreign countries, because you don’t have access to so many books; so many books just haven’t been translated into other languages. If you only spoke French, or you only spoke German, or you only spoke Hindi, for example, you would be at a severe disadvantage in a technical education.

Invariably, if you go and get a technical education, you have to learn English just because you have to read these books that have this data that has not been translated. Languages are probably the oldest example of network effect.

Money is another example. We should all probably be using the same money, except for the fact that geographic and regulatory boundaries have created these artificial islands of money. But even then, the world tends to use a single currency as the reserve currency at most times; currently, the US dollar.

Zero marginal cost businesses can pivot into network effect businesses

Network effects are a very powerful concept, and when you’re picking a business model, it’s a really good idea to pick a model where you can benefit from network effects, low marginal costs, and scale economies; and these tend to go together.

Anything that has zero marginal costs of production obviously has scale economies, and things that have zero marginal costs of reproduction very often tend to have network effects, because it doesn’t cost you anything more to stamp out the thing. So then you can just create little hooks for users to add value to each other.

You should always be thinking about how your users, your customers, can add value to each other because that is the ultimate form of leverage. You’re at the beach in the Bahamas or you’re sleeping at night and your customers are adding value to each other.

25. Example: From Laborer to Entrepreneur

The continuum from laborer to real estate tech company goes from low to high specific knowledge, accountability and leverage.

Laborers get paid hourly and have low accountability

Naval: The tweetstorm is very abstract. It’s deliberately meant to be broadly applicable to all kinds of different domains and disciplines and time periods and places. But sometimes it’s hard to work without a concrete example. So let’s go concrete for a minute.

Look at the real estate business. You could start at the bottom, let’s say you’re a day laborer. You come in, you fix people’s houses. Someone orders you around, tells you, “Break that piece of rock. Sand that piece of wood. Put that thing over there.”

There’s just all these menial jobs that go on, on a construction site. If you’re working one of those jobs, unless you’re a skilled trade, say, a carpenter or electrician, you don’t really have specific knowledge.

Even a carpenter or an electrician is not that specific because other people can be trained how to do it. You can be replaced. You get paid your $15, $20, $25, $50, if you’re really lucky, $75 an hour, but that’s about it.

You don’t have any leverage other than from the tools that you’re using. If you’re driving a bulldozer that’s better than doing it with your hands. A day laborer in India makes a lot less because they have no tool leverage.

You don’t have much accountability. You’re a faceless cog in a construction crew and the owner of the house or the buyer of the house doesn’t know or care that you worked on it.

General contractors get equity, but they’re also taking risk

One step up from that, you might have a contractor, like a general contractor who someone hires to come and fix and repair and build up their house. That general contractor is taking accountability; they’re taking responsibility.

Now let’s say they got paid $250,000 for the job. Sorry, I’m using Bay Area prices, so maybe I’ll go rest of the world prices, $100,000 for the job to fix up a house, and it actually costs the general contractor, all said and done, $70,000. That contractor’s going to pocket that remaining $30,000.

They got the upside. They got the equity but they’re also taking accountability and risk. If the project runs over and there’s losses, then they eat the losses. But you see, just the accountability gives them some form of additional potential income.

Then, they also have labor leverage because they have a bunch of people working for them. But it probably tops out right there.

Property developers pocket the profit by applying capital leverage

You can go one level above that and you can look at a property developer. This might be someone who is a contractor who did a bunch of houses, did a really good job, then decided to go into business for themselves and they go around looking for beaten down properties that have potential.

They buy them, they either raise money from investors or front it themselves, they fix the place up, and then they sell it for twice what they bought it for. Maybe they only put in 20% more, so it’s a healthy profit.

So now a developer like that takes on more accountability, has more risk. They have more specific knowledge because now you have to know: which neighborhoods are worth buying in. Which lots are actually good or which lots are bad. What makes or breaks a specific property. You have to imagine the finished house that’s going to be there, even when the property itself might look really bad right now.

There’s more specific knowledge, there’s more accountability and risk, and now you also have capital leverage because you’re also putting in money into the project. But conceivably, you could buy a piece of land or a broken-down house for $200,000 and turn it into a million dollar mansion and pocket all the difference.

Architects, large developers and REITs are even higher in the stack

One level beyond that might be a famous architect or a developer, where just having your name on a property, because you’ve done so many great properties, increases its value.

One level up from that, you might be a person who decides, well, I understand real estate, and I now know enough of the dynamics of real estate that rather than just build and flip my own properties or improve my own properties, I’m gonna be a massive developer. I’m going to build entire communities.

Now another person might say, “I like that leverage, but I don’t want to manage all these people. I want to do it more through capital. So I’m gonna start a real estate investment trust.” That requires specific knowledge not just about investing in real estate and building real estate, but it also requires specific knowledge about the financial markets, and the capital markets, and how real estate trusts operate.

Real estate tech companies apply the maximum leverage

One level beyond that might be somebody who says, “Actually, I want to bring the maximum leverage to bear in this market, and the maximum specific knowledge.” That person would say, “Well, I understand real estate, and I understand everything from basic housing construction, to building properties and selling them, to how real estate markets move and thrive, and I also understand the technology business. I understand how to recruit developers, how to write code and how to build good product, and I understand how to raise money from venture capitalists and how to return it and how all of that works.”

Obviously not a single person may know this. You may pull a team together to do it where each have different skill sets, but that combined entity would have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate.

It would have massive accountability because that company’s name would be a very high risk, high reward effort attached to the whole thing, and people would devote their lives to it and take on significant risk.

It would have leverage in code with lots of developers. It would have capital with investors putting money in and the founder’s own capital. It would have labor of some of the highest quality labor that you can find, which is high quality engineers and designers and marketers who are working on the company.

Then you may end up with a Trulia or a RedFin or a Zillow kind of company, and then the upside could potentially be in the billions of dollars, or the hundreds of millions of dollars.

As you layer in more and more kinds of knowledge that can only be gained on the job and aren’t common knowledge, and you layer in more and more accountability and risk-taking, and you layer in more and more great people working on it and more and more capital on it, and more and more code and media on it, you keep expanding the scope of the opportunity all the way from the day-laborer, who might just literally be scrappling on the ground with their hands, all the way up to somebody who started a real estate tech company and then took it public.

26. Judgment Is the Decisive Skill

Everything we’ve discussed so far has been setting you up to apply judgment.

In an age of infinite leverage, judgment becomes the most important skill

Nivi: We spoke about specific knowledge, we talked about accountability, we talked about leverage. The last skill that Naval talks about in his tweetstorm is judgment, where he says, that “Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.”

Naval: We are now living in an age of nearly infinite leverage, and all the great fortunes are created through leverage. Your first job is to go and obtain leverage, and you can obtain leverage through permission by getting people to work for you, or by raising capital.

Or you can get leverage permissionlessly by learning how to code or becoming good communicator and podcasting, broadcasting, creating videos, writing, etc.

That’s how you get leverage, but once you have leverage, what do you do with it? Well, the first part of your career’s spent hustling to get leverage. Once you have the leverage, then you wanna slow down a bit, because your judgment really matters.

It’s like you’ve gone from steering your sailboat around to now you’re steering an ocean liner or a tanker. You have a lot more at risk, but you have a lot more to gain as well. You’re carrying a much higher payload. In an age of infinite leverage, judgment becomes the most important skill.

Warren Buffett is so wealthy now because of his judgment. Even if you were to take away all of Warren’s money, tomorrow, investors would come out of the woodwork and hand him a $100 billion because they know his judgment is so good, and they would give him a big chunk of that $100 billion to invest.

Everything else you do is setting you up to apply judgment

Ultimately, everything else that you do is actually setting you up to apply your judgment. One of the big things that people rail on is CEO pay. For sure there’s crony capitalism that goes on where these CEOs control their boards and the boards give them too much money.

But, there are certain CEOs who definitely earned their keep because their judgment is better. If you’re steering a big ship, if you’re steering Google or Apple, and your judgment is 10 or 20 percent better than the next person’s, society will literally pay you hundreds of millions of dollars more, because you’re steering a $100 billion ship.

If you’re on course 10 or 20 percent of the time more often than the other person, the compounding results on that hundreds of billions of dollars you’re managing will be so large that your CEO pay will be dwarfed in comparison.

Demonstrated judgment, credibility around the judgment, is so critical. Warren Buffett wins here because he has massive credibility. He’s been highly accountable. He’s been right over and over in the public domain. He’s built a reputation for very high integrity, so you can trust him.

A person like that, people will throw infinite leverage behind him because of his judgment. Nobody asks him how hard he works; nobody asks him when he wakes up or when he goes to sleep. They’re like, “Warren, just do your thing.”

Judgment, especially demonstrated judgment, with high accountability, clear track record, is critical.

Judgment is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions

Nivi: Let’s define judgment. I would define it as knowing the long-term effects of your decisions, or being able to predict the long-term effects of your decisions.

Naval: It’s funny. My definition of wisdom is knowing the long term consequences of your actions, so they’re not all that different. Wisdom is just judgment on a personal domain.

Wisdom applied to external problems I think is judgment. They’re highly linked. But, yes, it’s knowing the long term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that.

Without experience, judgment is often less than useless

Judgment is very hard to build up. This is where both intellect and experience come in play.

There are many problems with the so-called intellectuals in the ivory tower, but one of the reasons why Nassim Taleb rails against them is because they have no skin in the game. They have no real-world experience, so they just apply purely intellect.

Intellect without any experience is often worse than useless because you get the confidence that the intellect gives you, and you get some of the credibility, but because you had no skin in the game, and you had no real experience, and no real accountability, you’re just throwing darts.

The real world is always far, far more complex than we can intellectualize. Especially all the interesting, fast-moving edge domains and problems, you can’t get there without experience. If you are smart and you iterate fast, it’s not even you put 10,000 hours into something, but you take 10,000 tries at something.

The people with the best judgment are among the least emotional

If you are smart and you have a lot of quick iterations, and you try to keep your emotions out of it, the people with the best judgment are actually among the least emotional. A lot of the best investors are considered almost robotic in that regard, but I wouldn’t be surprised if even the best entrepreneurs often come across as unemotional.

There is sort of this archetype of the passionate entrepreneur, and yeah, they have to care about what they’re doing, but they also have to see very clearly what’s actually happening. The thing that prevents you from seeing what’s actually happening are your emotions. Our emotions are constantly clouding our judgment, and in investing, or in running companies, or in building products, or being an entrepreneur, emotions really get in the way.

Emotions are what prevent you from seeing what’s actually happening, until you can no longer resist the truth of what’s happening, until it becomes too sudden, and then you’re forced into suffering; which is sort of a breaking of this fantasy that you had put together.

Nivi: To try and connect some of these concepts, I would say that, first, you’re accountable for your judgment. Judgment is the exercise of wisdom. Wisdom comes from experience; and that experience can be accelerated through short iterations.

A lot of the top investors often sound like philosophers

Naval: And the reason why a lot of the top investors, a lot of the value investors, like if you read Jeremy Grantham, or you read Warren Buffet, or you read up on Michael Burry, these people sound like philosophers, or they are philosophers, or they’re reading a lot of history books or science books.

Like what are they doing, shouldn’t they be reading investment books. No. Investment books are the worst place to learn about investment, because investment is a real-world activity that is highly multi-variate, all the advantages are always being competed away. It’s always on the cutting-edge.

What you actually just need is very, very broad-based judgment and thinking. The best way to do that is to study everything, including a lot of philosophy. Philosophy also makes you more stoic, makes you less emotional, and so you make better decisions; you have better judgment.

The more outraged someone is, the worse their judgment

One simple thing is I see … I go out on Twitter and it seems like half of Twitter is outraged at something at all times. You can go within someone’s Twitter feed and get at least some semblance of what it must be like to be in their head all the time.

The more outraged somebody is, I guarantee you, the worse their judgment is. If someone’s constantly tweeting political outrage, and just see like an angry person getting into fights, you don’t want to hand this person the keys to your car, let alone the keys to your company.

27. Set an Aspirational Hourly Rate

If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.

Set and enforce an aspirational hourly rate

Nivi: We covered the skills that you need to get rich. That was specific knowledge, accountability, leverage, judgment, and life-long learning. Let’s talk a little bit about the importance of working hard and valuing your time.

Naval: No one is going to value you more than you value yourself. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it. Even since I was young, I just decided I was worth a lot more than the market though I was worth, but I started treating myself that way.

Always factor your time into every decision. How much time does it take? Oh it’s gonna take me an hour to get across town to get this thing. I value myself at a $100 an hour; that’s basically throwing $100 out of my pocket. Am I going to do that?

You buy something from Amazon; they screwed it up, you have to return it. Is it worth your time to return it? Is it worth the mental hassle? Keep in mind that you have less work hours, you have less mentally high-output hours. Do you want to use them to run errands and solve little problems, or do you want to save them for the big stuff?

All the great scientists were terrible at managing their household life. None of them had a clean, organized room, or made all their social events on time, or sent their thank you cards.

You can’t penny pinch your way to wealth

You can spend your life however you want, but if you want to get rich, it has to be your number one overwhelming desire. Which means, it has to come before anything else; which means you can’t be penny-pinching. This is what people don’t understand.

You can penny-pinch your way to a basic sustenance. You can keep your expenses low, maybe retire early and not spend too much. That’s perfectly valid. But we’re here to talk about wealth creation. If you’re going to do that, then that has to be your number one overwhelming priority.

My aspirational rate was $5,000/hr

Fast forward to your wealthy self and pick some intermediate hourly rate. For me, believe it or not, back when you could have hired me … Which now obviously you can’t, but back when you could have hired me … this was true a decade ago or even two decades ago, before I had any real money. My hourly rate, I used to say to myself over and over is, $5,000 an hour. Today when I look back, really it was about $1,000 an hour [back then].

Of course, I still ended up doing stupid things, like arguing with the electrician, or returning the broken speaker, but I shouldn’t have, and I did a lot less than any of my friends would. I would make a theatrical show out of throwing something in the trash pile, or giving it to Salvation Army, rather than trying to return it, or handing something to people rather than trying to fix it.

I would argue with my girlfriends, and even today it’s my wife, “I don’t do that. That’s not a problem that I solve.” I still argue that, with my mother, when she hands me little to-do’s. I just don’t do that. I would rather hire you an assistant. This was true even when I didn’t have money.

If you can outsource something for less than your hourly rate, do it

Another way of thinking about something is, if you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That even includes things like cooking. You may want to eat your healthy home cooked meals, but if you can outsource it, do that instead.

I know some people will say, “Well what about the joy of life? What about getting it right just your way?” Sure, you can do that, but you’re not gonna be wealthy because now you’ve made something else a priority.

Paul Graham basically said it pretty well for Y Combinator startups, he said, “You should be working on your product and getting product-market fit. And you should be exercising and eating healthy.” That’s about it. That’s all you have time for while you’re on this mission.

Your hourly rate should seem absurdly high

Set a very high hourly aspirational rate for yourself and stick to it. It should seem and feel absurdly high. If it doesn’t, it’s not high enough. Whatever you picked, my advice to you would be to raise it. Like I said, for myself, even before I had money, for the longest time I used $5,000 an hour. And if you extrapolate that out into what it looks like as an annual salary, it’s the multiple millions of dollars per year.

Ironically, I actually think I’ve beaten it. I’m not the hardest working person; I’m actually a lazy person. I work through bursts of energy where I’m really motivated with something. If I actually look at how much I’ve earned per actual hour that I’ve put in, it’s probably quite a bit higher than that.

28. Work As Hard As You Can

Work as hard as you can. Even though what you work on and who you work with are more important.

Work as hard as you can

Naval: Let’s talk about hard work. There’s this battle that happens in Twitter a lot between, should you work hard and should you not. David Hauser’s (correction: David Heinemeier Hansson) on there saying, “It’s like you’re slave driving people.” Keith Rabois is always on there saying, “No, all the great founders worked their fingers to the bone.”

They’re talking past each other. First of all, they’re talking about two different things. David is talking about employees and a lifestyle business, which is fine. Your number one thing in life, if you’re doing that, is not getting wealthy. You have a job, you also have your family, you also have your life.

Keith is talking about the Olympics of startups. He’s talking about the person going for the gold medal and trying to build a multi-billion dollar public company. That person has to get everything right. They have to have great judgment. They have to pick the right thing to work on. They have to recruit the right team, and they have to work crazy hard. They’re basically engaged in a competitive sprint.

If getting wealthy is your goal, you are going to have to work as hard as you can. But hard work is absolutely no substitute for who you work with and what you work on. What you work on is probably the most important thing.

What you work on and who you work with are more important

Finding Product-Market-Founder Fit to expand on Marc Andreessen’s definition, he came up with Product-Market Fit. I will add Product-Market-Founder Fit, which is how well you are personally suited to that business. The combination of that three, that should be your overwhelming goal.

You can save yourself a lot of time if you pick the right area to work in. Picking the right people to work with is the next most important piece. Third comes how hard you work. They’re like three legs of a stool; if you shortchange on any one of them, the whole stool’s gonna fall down. It’s not like you can pick one over the other that easily.

The order of operations when you’re building a business, or even building your career, is first figure out, “What should I be doing? What is something where there is a market that is emerging? There’s a product that I can build that I’m excited to work on and something where I have specific knowledge and I’m really into it?”

Second, surround yourself with the best people possible, and no matter how high your bar is, raise your bar. You can be working with other people who are great enough. There’s someone greater out there to work with, you should go work with them.

I advise a lot of people who are looking at which startup to join in Silicon Valley. I say, “Basically pick the one that’s going to have the best alumni network for you in the future.” Look at the PayPal mafia. They worked with a bunch of geniuses, so they all got rich. Just try and pick based on the highest intelligence, energy, and integrity people that you can find.

Finally, once you’ve picked the right thing to work on and the right people to work with, then you work as hard as you can.

Nobody really works 80 hours a week

Now, this is where the mythology gets a little crazy. People who work 80, 120 hour weeks, a lot of that’s just status signaling. It’s showing off. Nobody really works 80 to 120 hours a week sustained at high output with mental clarity. Your brain breaks down. You just won’t have good ideas.

Really, the way people tend to work most effectively, especially in knowledge work, is they sprint as hard as they can while they’re working on something, and they’re inspired and they’re passionate; and then they rest. They take long breaks.

It’s more like a lion hunting and much less a marathon runner running. You sprint, then you rest, you re-assess, and then you try again. What you end up doing is you end up building a marathon of sprints.

Inspiration is perishable

Nivi just made the point to me on the side that inspiration is perishable, which is a very good point. When you have your inspiration, do it right then and there. This happens to me a lot with my tweetstorms. I’ve actually come out with a whole bunch of additional tweetstorms besides the ones that are already out there, but sometimes I just hesitate, or I just pause, and it just dies.

What I’ve learned is, if I’m inspired to write a blog post or to publish a tweetstorm, I should probably do it right away. Otherwise, it’s not going to get out there; I won’t come back to it. Inspiration is a beautiful and powerful thing, and when you have it, just seize it.

Impatience with actions, patience with results

People talk about impatience. When do you know to be impatient? When do you know to be patient? My glib tweet on this was, “Impatience with actions and patience with results.” I think that’s actually a good philosophy for life.

Anything you have to do, just get it done. Why wait? You’re not getting any younger. Your life is slipping away. You don’t want to spend it waiting in line. You don’t want to spend it traveling back and forth. You don’t want to spend it doing thing that you know ultimately aren’t part of your mission.

When you do them, you want to do them as quickly as you can while you do them well, with your full attention. But then you just have to give up on the results; you have to be patient with the results because you’re dealing with complex systems, you’re dealing with lots of people.

It takes a long time for markets to adopt products. It takes time for people to get comfortable working with each other. It takes time for great products to emerge as you polish away, polish away, polish away. Impatience with actions, patience with results. As Nivi said, inspiration is perishable. When you have inspiration, act on it right then and there.

If I have a problem that I discover in one of my businesses that needs to be solved, I basically won’t sleep until at least the resolution is in motion. This is just a personal failing, but if I’m on the board of a company, I’ll call the CEO. If I’m running the company, I’ll call my reports. If I am responsible, I’ll get on there, right then and there, and solve it.

If I don’t solve a problem the moment it happens, or if I don’t start moving towards solving it when it happens, I have no peace. I have no rest. I have no happiness until that problem is solved; so solve it as quickly as possible. I literally won’t sleep until it’s solved. Maybe that’s just a personal characteristic, but it’s worked out well in business.

29. Be Too Busy to “Do Coffee”

You should be too busy to “do coffee”, while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.

Be too busy to “do coffee” while keeping an uncluttered calendar

Naval: Then we squander our time with the death of 1,000 cuts. Another tweet I had was, “You should be too busy to do coffee, while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.” People who know me, know that I’m famous for simultaneously doing two things. One is having a very clean calendar. I have almost no meetings on it.

There are people that I meet with, when they see my calendar they almost weep, while at the same time, I am busy all the time. I’m always doing something. It’s usually “work-related” but it is whatever the highest impact thing is that needs to be done at that time and that I’m most interested or inspired about. But the only way to do that is to constantly, ruthlessly decline meetings.

People want to do coffee and build relationships, and that’s fine early in your career when you’re still exploring. But later in your career when you’re exploiting, and there are more things coming at you than you have time for, you have to ruthlessly cut meetings out of your life.

If someone wants to do a meeting, see if you can do it with a phone call instead. If they want to do a phone call, see if they can do it with an email instead. If they want to do with email, see if they can do with a text message instead. If they’re text messaging, you should probably be ignoring most text messages unless they’re urgent, true emergencies.

One has to be utterly ruthless about dodging meetings. When you do do meetings, do walking meetings, do standing meetings. Keep them short, keep them actionable, keep them small. Any meeting with eight people sitting around at a conference table, nothing is getting done in that meeting. You are literally just dying one hour at a time.

Nivi: “Doing coffee” reminds me of a old quote, I think from Steve Jobs, when they asked him, “Hey, why doesn’t Apple come to conventions?” Or “Why don’t you come to my convention?” His response was, “Well, then because we wouldn’t be here working.”

Naval: Yeah, I used to have a tough time turning people down for meetings, but now I just tell them outright. I just say, “Look, I don’t do non-transactional meetings. I don’t do meetings without a strict agenda. I don’t do meetings unless we absolutely have to.”

Nivi used to do this. He would email people when they would ask Nivi and I for a coffee meeting, to get to know you. He would say, “We don’t do meetings unless it’s life and death urgent.” And then that person has to basically respond, “Yeah, it’s life and death urgent” or there’s no meeting.

People will meet with you when you have proof of work

When you have something important or something valuable, other busy, interesting people will meet with you. Your calling card has to be, “Hey, here’s what I’ve done. Here’s what I can show you. Let’s meet and I’ll be respectful of your time if this is useful to you.”

I find that there are very busy important people who will take your meeting, but you have to come with a proper calling card. All the people who tweet and who email famous or rich people saying, “Hey, if I could just get one meeting with you,” and they’re vague about it, they’re not going to get anywhere in life.

You have to build up the credibility. When, for example, an investor in the tech business and the venture business looks at a startup, the first thing they want to see is, they want to see some evidence of product progress. They don’t just want to even see a slide deck, they want to see a product progress, because the product progress is the resume for the entrepreneur. It is the unshakable, unfake-able resume.

You have to do the work. To use a crypto analogy, you have to have proof of work. If you have proof of work, and you truly have something interesting, then you shouldn’t hesitate to put it together in an email and send it to somebody. Even then, when you’re asking for a meeting, you wanna be super actionable about it.

Networking is overrated even early in your career

But I would say, even if you yourself haven’t made it yet, if you think you’re going to make it by going out and networking and doing a whole bunch of meetings, you’re probably incorrect. Yes, networking can be important early in your career, and yes you can get serendipitous with meetings, but the odds are pretty low.

As we spent time talking about earlier, when you are just meeting people and hoping to get that lucky break, you’re relying on Type One Luck, which is Blind Luck, and Type Two Luck, which is Hustle Luck.

But what you’re not getting, is Type Three or Type Four Luck, which are the better kinds where you spend time developing a reputation, working on something; developing a unique point of view, and being able to spot opportunities that others can’t.

A busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to do great things in this world. If you want to be able to do great things, whether you’re a musician, or whether you are an entrepreneur, or whether you’re an investor, you need free time and you need a free mind.

30. Keep Redefining What You Do

Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

Keep redefining what you do until you’re the best at what you do

Nivi: We just finished talking about the importance of working hard and valuing your time. Next there’s a few tweets on the topic of working for the long term. The first tweet is, “Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.”

Naval: If you really want to get paid in this world, you want to be number one at whatever it is that you’re doing. And it can be niche, that’s the point. It can literally be, you’re getting paid for just being you.

At this point some of the more successful people in the world are that way. Oprah gets paid for being Oprah. Joe Rogan gets paid for being Joe Rogan. They’re being authentic to themselves.

So what this tweet is trying to say simultaneously is that you want to be number one, but you want to keep changing what you do until you’re number one. You can’t just pick something arbitrary. You can’t say, “I’m going to be the fastest runner in the world and now you got to beat Usain Bolt.” That’s too hard of a problem.

But what you can do is you can keep changing what your objective is until it arrives to your specific knowledge, your skills sets, your position, your capabilities, your location, your interests. And then converges to making you number one.

When you’re searching for what to do you actually have two different foci that you have to keep in mind at all points. And one of those is, “I want to be the best at what I do.” And a second is, “What I do is flexible so that I am the best at it.”

Until you arrive at a comfortable place where like, “Yes this is something I can be amazing at while still being authentic to who I am.” And this is not going to be an overnight discovery. It’s going to be a long journey but at least you know about how to think about it.

Find founder-product-market fit

The most important thing for a company is to find product-market fit. I would say the most important thing for entrepreneur is to find founder-product-market fit. Where you are naturally inclined to build the right product which has a market and that’s a three focus problem. Which is you got to make all three of those work at once.

If you want to be successful in life you just have to get comfortable managing multi-variate problems, multiple objective functions at once. And this is one of those cases where you have to map at least two or three at once.

31. Escape Competition Through Authenticity

Competition can make you play the wrong game. No one can compete with you on being you.

Competition will trap you in a lesser game

Nivi: This reminds me of your tweet about escaping competition through authenticity. It sounds like part of this is a search for who you are.

Naval: It’s both a search, and a recognition because sometimes when we search our egos, we want to be something that we are not. And our friends and family are better at telling us actually who we are, or looking back at what we’ve done is a better indicator of who we are.

Peter Thiel talks a lot about how competition is besides the point. It’s counterproductive. We’re highly memetic creatures, we copy what everybody else is doing around us. We copy our desires from them.

If everyone around me is a great artist, I want to be an artist. If everyone around me is a great business person, I want to be a business person. If everybody around me is a social activist, I want to be a social activist. That’s where my self-esteem will come from.

You have to be a little careful when you get caught up in these status games, you end up competing over things that aren’t worth competing over. So, Peter Thiel talks about how he was going to be a law clerk because he was in law school and everybody around him wanted to be a law clerk for a Supreme Court Justice or some famous judge. And he got rejected and that’s what made him go into business. It helped him break out of a lesser game into a greater game.

So, sometimes you get trapped in the wrong game because you’re competing, and the best way to escape competition, to get away from the specter of competition, which is not just stressful and nerve-wracking but will also drive you to just the wrong answer, the way to escape competition is to just be authentic to yourself.

No one can compete with you on being you

If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is just an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that. Who’s going to compete with Joe Rogan or Scott Adams? It’s impossible. Is somebody else going to come along and write a better Dilbert? No, is someone going to compete with Bill Watterson and create a better Calvin and Hobbes, no. They’re being authentic.

This is easiest to see in art. Artist are by definition all naturally authentic. But even entrepreneurs are authentic. Who’s going to be Elon Musk, who’s going to be Jack Dorsey? These people are authentic and the businesses and products that they create are authentic to their desires and their means.

If somebody else came along and started launching rockets I don’t think it would faze Elon one bit. He’s still going to get to Mars because that’s his mission, insane as it seems, that’s the one he set for himself, he’s going to accomplish it.

So, authenticity naturally gets you away from competition. Does it mean that you necessarily want to be authentic to the point where there’s no product-market fit? It may turn out you’re the best juggler on the unicycle but maybe there isn’t that much of a market for that even with YouTube videos. So you got to adjust that somehow until you find product-market fit.

But at least lean towards authenticity, towards getting away from competition. And competition automatically leads towards copy-catting and often towards just playing completely the wrong game.

In entrepreneurship, the masses are never right

Especially in entrepreneurship the masses are never right. If you see a lot of people tweeting about what a great market to enter is, or you see journalist talking about a company is terrible, they don’t know anything. If the masses knew how to build great things and create great wealth we’d all already be done. We’d all already be rich by now.

So, in a sense when you see a lot of competition, sometimes that indicates to you that the masses are already here, so it’s already competed over too much and there’s nothing here, or it’s the wrong trend to begin with.

On the other hand if it’s completely empty, if the whole market is empty and there’s no one there, that can also be a warning indicator that you’ve gone too authentic and not enough on the product-market fit part of founder-product-market fit.

So there’s a balance. You have to find it. But generally most people will make the mistake of paying too much attention to the competition and being too much like the competition and not being authentic enough, and the great founders tend to be authentic iconoclasts.

Combine your vocation and avocation

Nivi: I hate to bring up the Scott Adams skill stack one more time but I’ll still bring it up. Do you think one way of getting to authenticity is just by not necessarily adding some random skills that you think might be important but just really finding five or six various skills that you already authentically do and just stacking them on top of each other and not even in any purposeful way. If you are expressing who you are, you’re going to be expressing all these little five or six different skills anyway.

Naval: That’s really where life is going to lead you anyway. Long term, if you are good and successful at what you do you will find that whatever your hobbies were, you’re almost doing them for a living. As Robert Frost said, combine your vocation and your avocation. What you love to do and what you do, do. So I think you’ll find yourself there anyway.

And you’re right about the skill stack. Everyone’s got multiple skills we aren’t all one-dimensional creatures even though that’s how we have to portray ourselves in our online profiles to get employed. You meet somebody and they say, “I’m a banker.” Or, “I’m a bartender. Or “I’m a barber.” What have you, all the b’s.

But people are multivariate. They have a lot of skills. One banker might be good at finance another one might be good at sales. A third one might be just good at macroeconomic trends and have a feel for the markets. Another one might be really good at picking individual stocks. Another might just be good at maintaining relationships rather than selling new relationships. Everyone’s going to have their various niches and you’re going to have multiple niches, it’s not going to be just one.

So over time you will find, as you go through your career both you will gravitate towards the things that you’re good at, which by definition are almost the things you enjoy doing, otherwise you wouldn’t be good at them. You wouldn’t have put in the time.

And other people will push you towards the things that you’re good at because your smart bosses and your smart co-workers and your smart investors will realize, “Okay you’re really world class in this thing and you’ll recruit somebody else with that other thing.” So, ideally you want to end up specializing in being you.

32. Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes

Competition will blind you to greater games. You’re one step away from a better market.

Businesses that seem like they’re in direct competition really aren’t

Nivi: I think when you’re being authentic, you don’t really mind competition that much. Yeah, it pisses you off and it inspires some fear and jealousy and all the other emotions that come along with it, but also you don’t really mind because you’re more oriented towards the goal and the mission and worst case you get some ideas from them. And there’s often ways to work with the competition in a positive way and it ends up increasing the size of the market for you.

Naval: Yeah sometimes it depends on the nature of the business. Silicon Valley tech industry businesses tend to be winner-take-all. At least the good ones. And so when you see competition it can make you fly into a rage because it really does endanger everything you’ve built.

Whereas if I was opening a restaurant and a more interesting version of the same restaurant opens up in a different town that’s fantastic I’m just going to lift from them what’s working and drop what I can see that they have already figured out is not working. So it does depend to some extent on the nature of the business.

That said, even the businesses that seem that they’re often in direct competition really aren’t. They can end up adjacent or slightly different. You’re one step away from a completely different business and sometimes you need to take that one step and you’re not going to be able to take it if you’re busy fighting over a booby prize.

You’re playing a stupid game you’re going to win a stupid prize. It’s not obvious right now because you’re blinded by competition, but three years from now it’ll be obvious.

My first company got caught up in the wrong game

To give a simple example, when I was first starting companies, one of my first ones was called Epinions which was an online product review site for all the products out there that was independent of Amazon and that space eventually turned into TripAdvisor and Yelp which is where we should have gone.

We should have done more local reviews because there’s more value to having a review of a scarce item like a local restaurant that it is of an item like a camera which was going to have a 1000 reviews on Amazon.

But before we could get there we got caught up in the whole comparison shopping game and so we ended up merging with DealTime and we competed with mySimon and Bizrate which became Shopzilla and PriceGrabber, NexTag and a whole bunch of these price comparison engines. And we’re all caught in fierce competition with each other and that whole space went to zero because it turns out that Amazon won e-tail completely. So there was no need for price comparison, everyone just went to Amazon.

But we got the booby prize because we were caught in the competition with a bunch of our peers when really we should have been looking at what the consumer really wanted and being authentic to ourselves which is reviews, not price comparison. And gone more and more into more and more esoteric items that needed to be reviewed where customers had less and less data and wanted reviews more badly. If we had stayed authentic to ourselves we would have done better.

33. Eventually You Will Get What You Deserve

Apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually you will get what you deserve.

On a long enough time scale you will get paid

Nivi: We’re still talking about working for the long term, the next tweet on that topic is “Apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually you will get what you deserve.” I would also add to that apply judgment, apply accountability and apply the skill of reading.

Naval: This one is just a glib way of saying that it takes time, even once you have all of these pieces in place, there is an indeterminate amount of time that you’re going to have to put in. And if you’re counting you’ll run out of patience before it actually arrives.

So you just have to make sure that you give these things a proper time, life is long, and Charlie Munger had some line on this. Somebody asked him about making money and he reinterpreted that and he said what the questioner was actually asking was, “How do I get rich like you but faster before I end up as a really old guy?”

And everybody wants it immediately but the world is an efficient place, immediate doesn’t work. You do have to put in the time. You do have to put in the hours and so I think you just have to put yourself in the position with the specific knowledge, with the accountability, with the leverage, with the authentic skill set that you have to be the best in the world at what you do.

And then you have to enjoy it and just keep doing it and keep doing it and keep doing it and don’t keep track and don’t keep count because if you do you will run out of time. I can look back at my career and the people two decades ago I had identified as brilliant and hardworking but hadn’t thought much more about it, they’re all successful now, almost without exception.

On a long enough time scale you do get paid but it can easily be 10 or 20 years. Sometimes it’s five and if it’s five or three and a friend of yours got there it can drive you insane. But, those are exceptions. And for every winner there’s multiple failures.

One thing that’s important in entrepreneurship is you just have to be right once. You get many, many shots on goal. You can take shot on goal every three to five years, maybe every 10 at the slowest or once every year at the fastest depending upon how you’re iterating with startups but you really only have to be right once.

What are you really good at that the market values?

Nivi: My little equation is that your eventual outcome will be equal to something like the distinctiveness of your specific knowledge times how much leverage you can apply to that knowledge times how often your judgment is correct times how singularly accountable you are for the outcome times how much society values what you’re doing. And then you compound all of that with how long you can keep doing it and how long you can keep improving it through reading and learning.

Naval: That’s actually a really good way to summarize it. It’s probably worth even trying to sketch that equation out.

That said, people try to then apply mathematics to what is really philosophy. So I’ve seen this happen in the past where I say one thing and then I say another thing that seems contradictory if you treat it as a math equation.

But it’s obviously in a different context and then people will say, “Well you say that desire is suffering,” you know, the Buddhist saying, and then you say, “All greatness comes from suffering. So does that mean all greatness come from desire?” Well this isn’t math people, you can’t just start carrying variables around and forming absolute logical outputs. You have to know when to apply things.

I think that is very useful to understand but at the same time one can’t get too analytical about it. It’s what a physicist would call false precision. When you take two made up estimates and you multiply them together and you get four degrees of precision and those decimal points don’t actually count. You don’t have that data. You don’t have that knowledge. In a model, the more estimated variables you have, the greater the error in the model.

So, just adding more and more complexity to your decision making process actually gets you a worse answer. You’re better off just picking the single biggest thing or two. For example, what am I really good at according to observation and according to people that I trust, that the market values?

That alone, those two variables alone are probably good enough because if you’re good at it you’ll keep it up. And if you’re good at it you’ll develop the judgment. And if you’re good at it and you like to do it eventually people will give you the resources and you won’t be afraid to take on accountability. So all the other pieces will fall in place.

Product-market fit is inevitable if you’re doing something you love to do and the market wants it.

34. Reject Most Advice

Most advice is people giving you their winning lottery ticket numbers.

The best founders listen to everyone but make up their own mind

Nivi: Regarding the guy who gets rich in five years, one of the tweets that you had on the cutting room floor was: avoid people who got rich quickly, they’re just giving you their winning lottery ticket numbers.

Naval: This is generally true of advice anyway, which is it’s back to Scott Adams, systems not goals. If you ask a specific person what worked for them very often it’s just like they’re reading out the exact set of things worked for them which might not be applicable for you. They’re just reading you out their winning lottery ticket numbers.

It’s a little glib. There is something to be learned from them. But you can’t just take their exact circumstance and map it onto yours. The best founders I know, they listen and read to everyone. But then they ignore everybody. And they make up their own mind.

They have their own internal model of how to apply things to their situation and they do not hesitate to discard information. If you survey enough people all the advice will cancel to zero.

You do have to have your own point of view and when something is sent your way have to very quickly decide, is that true? Is that true outside of the context of what that person applied it in? Is it true in my context? And then do I want to apply it? You have to reject most advice but you have to listen to and read enough of it to know what to reject and what to accept.

Even in this podcast you should examine everything. If something does not feel true to you put it down, set it aside. If too many things seem untrue, delete this podcast.

Advice is maxims you can recall later, when you get your own experience

Nivi: I think the most dangerous part of taking advice is that the person that gave it to you is not going to be around to tell you when it doesn’t apply any longer.

Naval: I view the purpose of advice as a little different than most people. I just view it as helping me have anecdotes and maxims that I can then later recall when I have my own direct experience and say, “Ah that’s what that person meant.”

90% of my tweets are actually just maxims that I carve from myself that are then little mental hooks to remind me when I’m in that situation again, like, “Oh I’m the one who tweeted, if you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, then don’t work with them for a day.” So, as soon as I know that this person is not going to be someone that I’m going to be working with 10 years from now then I have to start extricating myself from that relationship or just not investing that much more effort into it.

So, I use my tweets and other people’s tweets as maxims that help compress my own learnings and be able to recall them. The brain space is finite, you have finite neurons, so you can almost think of these as pointers, addresses, mnemonics to help you remember deep-seated principles where you have the underlying experience to back it up.

If you don’t have the underlying experience then it just reads like a collection of quotes. It’s like it’s cool, it’s inspirational for a moment, maybe make a nice poster out of it but then you forget it and move on. So, all of these are really just compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge.

35. A Calm Mind, a Fit Body, a House Full of Love

When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place.

When you’re wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking

Nivi: The last tweet on the topic of working for the long term is that “When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that’s for another day.”

Naval: That’s a multi-hour topic in of itself. First of all I thought it was a really clever way to end the whole thing because it disarms a whole set of people who say, “What’s the point of getting rich?” Because there’s a lot of people who just like the status signal, virtue signal, against the idea of wealth creation or making money. So it was just a good way to disarm all of them.

But, it’s also true. In that the things that you really want in life, yes money will solve all your money problems but it doesn’t get you everywhere.

The first thing you realize when you’ve made a bunch of money is that you’re still the same person. If you’re happy, you’re happy. If you’re unhappy, you’re unhappy. If you’re calm and fulfilled and peaceful you’re still that same person. I know lots of very rich people who are extremely out of shape. I know lots of rich people who have really bad family lives. I know lots of rich people who are internally a mess.

A calm mind, a fit body and a house full of love must be earned

So, I would lean on another tweet that I put out which is actually, when I think back on it, I think it’s my favorite tweet of mine. It’s not necessarily the most insightful, it’s not necessarily the most helpful. It’s not even the one I think about the most but when I look at it there’s such a certain truth in there that it just resonates. And that is that “A calm mind, a fit body and a house full of love. These things can not be bought. They must be earned.”

Even if you have all the money in the world you can’t have those three things. Jeff Bezos still has to workout. He still has to work on his marriage or whatever his next relationship is. And his internal mental state is still going to be very much not controlled by external events. It’s going to be based on how calm and peaceful he is inside.

So I think those three things, your health, your mental health and your close relationships are things that you have to cultivate and can probably bring you a lot more peace and happiness than any amount of money ever will.

Practical advice for a calmer internal state

So, that’s what I meant. Now, how to get there is actually a tweetstorm that I still need to put out. I’ve been working on it. I have probably a hundred tweets on it. It’s just very hard to say anything on the topic without getting attacked from 50 different directions, especially these days on Twitter. So I’ve been hesitant to do it because I want to target it for a very specific kind of person.

There’s a bunch of people who don’t believe that working on your internal state is useful. They’re too focused on the external. And that’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with that, they should do that and that’s who the how the get rich tweetstorm is for. There’s a bunch of people who believe that the only thing worth working on is complete liberation, like you become the Buddha, and they’ll attack anything in the middle as being useless. That’s fine too but most people aren’t there.

So, what I want to do is to create a tweetstorm that is just very practical advice for everyday people who want to have a calmer internal state. A set of understandings, realizations, half truths and truths, that if you were to imbibe them properly, and again these are just pointers to ideas that you already have and experiences that you already have. That if you keep these top of mind, slowly but steadily it will help you with certain realizations that will lead you to a calmer internal state. That’s what I want to work on.

Fitness is another big one, I’m just not the expert there. There are plenty of good people on Twitter that who are better fitness than me.

A lot of divorces happen over money, a lot of battles happen over internal anger

And I think a loving household and relationships actually automatically falls out of the other things. If you have a calm mind and if you’ve already made money, you should have a good relationship. There’s not reason why you shouldn’t. A lot of divorces actually happen over money, unfortunately that’s just the reality of it, so having money removes that part of it.

A lot of external battles happen because you’re internal state is not good. When you’re naturally internally peaceful you’re going to pick less fights. You’re going to be more loving without expecting anything in return and that will take care of things on the external relationship front.

Nivi: So, money solves your money problems. Money buys you freedom in the material world, I think that was a tweet from your cutting room floor, and money lets you not do the things that you don’t want to do.

Naval: Yeah to me the ultimate purpose of money so you do not have to be in a specific place at a specific time doing anything you don’t want to do.

36. There Are No Get Rich Quick Schemes

Get rich quick schemes are just someone else getting rich off you.

There are no get rich quick schemes

Nivi: We skipped one tweet because I wanted to cover all of the tweets on the topic of the long term. And the tweet that we skipped was, “There are no get rich quick schemes. That’s just someone else getting rich off you.”

Naval: This goes back to the world being an efficient place. If there’s an easy way to get rich it’s already been exploited. And there are a lot of people who will sell you ideas and schemes on how to make money but they’re just always selling you some $79.95 course or some audiobook or some seminar .

Which is fine, everyone needs to eat. People need to make a living. They might actually have really good tips but if they’re giving you actionable, high quality advice that acknowledges that it’s a difficult journey and will take a lot of time, then I think that’s realistic.

But, if they’re selling you some get rich quick scheme whether it’s crypto or whether it’s an online business or seminar they’re just making money off you. That’s their get rich quick scheme. It’s not going to necessarily work for you.

We don’t have ads because it would ruin our credibility

One of the things about this whole tweetstorm and podcast is that we don’t have ads on here. We don’t charge for anything. We don’t sell anything. Not because I don’t want to make more money, it’s always nice to make more money, we’re doing work here. But, because it would completely destroy the credibility of the enterprise. If I am saying, “Hey I know how to get rich and I’m going to sell that to you.” It’s ruins it.

When I was young and I was studying up on the topic one of my favorite books on the topic was actually called, How To Get Rich by Felix Dennis, the founder of Maxim Magazine, billionaire who passed away. And he had a lot of crazy stuff in there but he had some really good insights too.

But whenever I read something my him or by the GoDaddy founder, Bob Parsons, or Andrew Carnegie. You read stuff by people who are already very wealthy and they clearly made their wealth in other fields, not by selling the how to get rich line, they have a credibility. You just trust them.

And they’re not trying to make money off of you. They are obviously trying to win some status and some ego, right, you always have to have a motivation for doing something. But, at least that is a cleaner reason why they’re probably not lying. They’re probably not fooling you. They’re not snowing you.

Every founder has to lie to every employee

At some level every founder has to lie to every employee of the company that they have. Where they have to convince them that it’s better for you to work for me than it is to do what I did and go work for yourself. So I’ve always had a hard time with that.

Which is why the only honest way, in my companies I’ve recruited entrepreneurs and I tell them, “You’re going to get to be entrepreneurial in this company and the day the you’re ready to go start your own next thing I’m going to support you. I’m never going to get in the way of you starting a company. But this can be a good place for you to learn how to build a good team and build a good culture, how to find product-market fit to perfect your skills and meet some amazing people while you figure out exactly what it is you’re going to do, because positioning, timing, deliberation, are very important when starting a company.”

But what I’ve never been able to do is look them in the face and say, “You must be at your desk by 8 AM.” Because I’m not going to be at my desk by 8 AM, I want my freedom. Or say to them that you’re great at being a director today and you’ll be a VP tomorrow. Putting them into that cold career path track because I don’t believe in it myself.

Anyone giving advice on how to get rich should have made their money elsewhere

If anyone is giving advice on how to get rich and they’re also making money off of it, they should have made their money elsewhere. You don’t want to learn how to be fit from a fat person. You don’t want to learn how to be happy from a depressed person. So, you don’t want to learn how to be rich from a poor person but you also don’t want to learn how to be rich from somebody who makes their money by telling people how to be rich. It’s suspect.

Nivi: Anytime you see somebody who’s actually gotten rich following some guru’s advice on getting rich, just remember that in any random process, if you run it long enough and if enough people participate in it you will always get every single possible outcome with probability one.

Naval: There’s a lot of random error in there and then also, this is why you have to absolutely and completely ignore business journalists and economist academics when they talk about private companies.

I won’t even name names but when a famous economist rails on Bitcoin or when a business journalist attacks the latest company that’s IPO’ing, it’s complete nonsense. Those people have never built anything, they’re professional critics. They don’t know anything about making money. All they know is how to criticize and get pageviews. And you’re literally becoming dumber by reading them. You’re burning neurons.

I’ll leave you with a quote from the Nassim Taleb that I liked where he said, “If you want to be a philosopher king first become a king then become a philosopher. Not first become a philosopher and then become a king.”

Nivi: I’m glad you brought up Taleb because I was going to finish this by saying just remember the title of his first book which is Fooled By Randomness.

Naval: One of the reasons why we’re a little vague in this podcast is because we’re trying to lay down principles that are timeless as opposed to just giving you the winning lottery ticket numbers from yesterday.

37. Productize Yourself

Figure out what you’re uniquely good at and apply as much leverage as possible.

Figure out what you’re uniquely good at and apply as much leverage as possible 

Nivi: You summarized this entire tweetstorm with two words. “Productize yourself.”

Naval: Productize and yourself. Yourself has uniqueness. Productize has leverage. Yourself has accountability. Productize has specific knowledge. Yourself also has specific knowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine them into these two words.

Whenever you’re doing anything in business, if you’re looking towards the long-term of getting wealthy you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with code or with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple mnemonic.

What is this podcast? This is a podcast called Naval. I’m literally productizing myself with a podcast.

Nivi: You want to figure out what you’re uniquely good at, or what you uniquely are, and apply as much leverage as possible. So making money isn’t even something you do, it’s not a skill. It’s who you are, stamped out a million times.

Find hobbies that make you rich, fit and creative

Naval: Making money should be a function of your identity and what you like to do. Another tweet that I really liked was… this was not mine, somebody else put this up. They said “Find three hobbies. One that makes you money, one that keeps you fit, and one that makes you creative.”

I would change that slightly. I would say one that makes you money, one that makes you fit, and one that makes you smarter. In my case, my hobbies would be reading, making money as I love working with startups. Either investing in them, brainstorming them, starting them. I just love that ideation and initial creation phase around startups.

Then on the hobby that keeps you fit, I don’t really have one. Closest thing I have is yoga, but that’s where I sort of fell apart. I think people who, early in life, discover something like surfing or swimming or tennis or some kind of a sport that they continue doing throughout most of their life are very luck because they found a hobby that will make them fit.
